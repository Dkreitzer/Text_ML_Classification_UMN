[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. <U+FEFF>. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material also may impair our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. If any of the risks described below or if any other risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material actually occurs, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.. <U+FEFF>. We face significant competition in many aspects of our business, which could cause our revenue and gross profit margins to decline. Competition could also cause us to reduce sales prices or to incur additional marketing or production costs, which could result in decreased revenue, increased costs and reduced margins.. <U+FEFF>. We compete for customers with a wide variety of producers of equipment and software for models, prototypes, other three-dimensional objects and end-use parts as well as producers of materials and services for this equipment. Some of our existing and potential competitors are researching, designing, developing and marketing other types of competitive equipment and software, materials and services. Certain of these competitors may have financial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours.. <U+FEFF>. We also expect that future competition may arise from the development of allied or related techniques for equipment and materials that are not encompassed by our patents, from the issuance of patents to other companies that may inhibit our ability to develop certain products and from improvements to existing materials and equipment technologies.. <U+FEFF>. Some of our patents have recently expired and others will expire in coming years. Upon expiration of those patents, our competitors may introduce products using the technology previously protected by the expired patents and those products may have lower prices than those of our products. To compete, we may need to reduce our prices for those products, which could adversely affect our revenues, margins and profitability. Additionally, the expiration of our patents could reduce barriers to entry into additive manufacturing, which could result in the reduction of our sales and earnings potential. If competitors using technology previously protected by our expired patents were to introduce products of inferior quality, our potential customers may view the technology negatively, which would have an adverse effect on our image and reputation and on our ability to compete with systems using other additive fabrication technologies.. <U+FEFF>. We intend to follow a strategy of continuing product development to enhance our position to the extent practicable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current position in the field or continue to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition. If we do not keep pace with technological change and introduce new products, we may lose revenue and demand. 10. for our products. We also incur significant costs associated with the investment in our product development in furtherance of our strategy that may not result in increased revenue or demand for our products and that could negatively affect our operating results.. <U+FEFF>. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to deliver products that meet changing technology and customer needs.. <U+FEFF>. Our business may be affected by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new standards and practices, any of which could render our existing products and proprietary technology obsolete. Accordingly, our ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable us to maintain technological leadership. We believe that to remain competitive we must continually enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. However, there is a risk that we may not be able to:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDevelop or obtain leading technologies useful in our business;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEnhance our existing products;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDevelop new products, services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective customers, particularly in the area of printer speeds and materials functionality;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis; or. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRecruit or retain key technology employees.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to meet changing technology and customer needs, our competitive position, revenue, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. We have made, and may make in the future, strategic acquisitions that may involve significant risks and uncertainties.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert management attention.. <U+FEFF>. From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that fit our business objectives. For example, in January 2017, we acquired Vertex-Global Holding B.V. (\"Vertex\"), a provider of dental materials. Acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner, which may also impact our ability to realize the potential benefits associated with the acquisition;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration may be encountered;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that our marketplaces do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in the marketplaces that we serve;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying party;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe inability to maintain a relationship with key customers, vendors and other business partners of the acquired businesses;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk of diverting management attention from our existing operations;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties in coordinating geographically disparate organizations and corporate cultures and integrating management personnel with different business backgrounds;. 11. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe potential failure of the due diligence process to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that we incur significant costs associated with such acquisition activity that may negatively impact our operating results before the benefits of such acquisitions are realized, if at all;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk of incurring significant goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk of incurring significant exit costs if products or services are unsuccessful;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe entry into marketplaces where we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger marketplace positions;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with our assuming claims or litigation risks from terminated employees, customers, former shareholders or other third parties; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that historical financial information may not be representative or indicative of our results as a combined company.. <U+FEFF>. Historically, we have grown organically and from acquisitions, and we intend to continue to grow. Our infrastructure will require, among other things, continued development of our financial and management controls and management information systems, management of our sales channel, continued capital expenditures, the ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel and the training of new personnel. We cannot be sure that our infrastructure, systems, procedures, business processes and managerial controls will be adequate to support the growth in our operations. Any delays in, or problems associated with, implementing, or transitioning to, new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls to accommodate and support the requirements of our business and operations and to effectively and efficiently integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our ability to meet customer requirements, manage our product inventory, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. These potential negative effects could prevent us from realizing the benefits of an acquisition transaction or other growth opportunity. In that event, our competitive position, revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. Changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired.. <U+FEFF>. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to dispose of a business or product line. We face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in customer demand. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. Future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. We may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.. <U+FEFF>. In connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights or disputes related to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention and energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. Third-party intellectual property claims asserted against us could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from assembling or licensing certain of our products, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the marketplaces in which we compete or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. In. 12. addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products. Any of these could seriously harm our business.. <U+FEFF>. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information, including our digital content, from third-party infringers or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.. <U+FEFF>. Although we defend our intellectual property rights and endeavor to combat unlicensed copying and use of our digital content and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques, preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights (\"piracy attacks\") is inherently difficult. If our intellectual property becomes subject to piracy attacks, our business may be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. Additionally, we endeavor to protect the secrecy of our digital content, confidential information and trade secrets. If unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets occurs, we could potentially lose trade secret protection. The loss of trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying previously confidential features, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements. However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations it may be difficult and/or costly for us to enforce our rights.. <U+FEFF>. Our business could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.. <U+FEFF>. We have experienced cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. Prior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our business or financial results; however, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber security assessment analyses undertaken by us have identified and prioritized steps to enhance our cyber security safeguards. We are in the process of implementing these recommendations to enhance our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures. Despite the implementation of these new safeguards, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of the products and services we provide. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.. <U+FEFF>. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to our customers, our financial results or our reputation; or such events could result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property or early obsolescence of our products and services.. <U+FEFF>. If we do not generate net cash flow from operations and if we are unable to raise additional capital, our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute our growth strategy.. <U+FEFF>. We cannot assure you that we will generate cash from operations or other potential sources to fund future working capital needs and meet capital expenditure requirements.. <U+FEFF>. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring or incurring additional debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to obtain additional capital or refinance any indebtedness will depend on, among other things, the capital markets, our financial condition at such time and the terms and conditions of any such financing or indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. <U+FEFF>. The lack of additional capital resulting from any inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise equity or debt financing could force us to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any necessary funds, if available, would be available on attractive terms or that they would not have a significantly dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If our financial condition were to worsen and we become unable to attract additional equity or debt financing or enter into other strategic transactions, we could become insolvent or be forced to declare bankruptcy, and we would not be able to execute our growth strategy.. 13. <U+FEFF>. Global economic, political and social conditions and financial markets may harm our ability to do business, adversely affect our sales, costs, results of operations and cash flow.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to global economic, political and social conditions that may cause customers to delay or reduce technology purchases due to economic downturns, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, geopolitical uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. We face risks that may arise from financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, resellers or customers, including, among others, the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCustomers or partners to whom we sell our products and services may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to our inability to obtain payment of accounts receivable that those customers may owe;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCustomers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tKey suppliers of raw materials, finished products or components used in the products that we sell may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to disruption in the supply of printers, materials or spare parts to our customers; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe inability of customers, including resellers, suppliers and contract manufacturers, to obtain credit financing to finance purchases of our products and raw materials used to build those products.. <U+FEFF>. Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.. <U+FEFF>. Our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be cancelled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as an information systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.. <U+FEFF>. The variety of products that we sell could cause significant quarterly fluctuations in our gross profit margins, and those fluctuations in margins could cause fluctuations in operating income or loss and net income or loss.. <U+FEFF>. We continuously work to expand and improve our products, materials and services offerings, the number of geographic areas in which we operate and the distribution channels we use to reach various target product applications and customers. This variety of products, applications and channels involves a range of gross profit margins that can cause substantial quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins depending upon the mix of product shipments from quarter to quarter. Additionally, the introduction of new products or services may further heighten quarterly fluctuations in gross profit and gross profit margins due to manufacturing ramp-up and start-up costs. We may experience significant quarterly fluctuations in gross profit margins or operating income or loss due to the impact of the mix of products, channels or geographic areas in which we sell our products from period to period.. <U+FEFF>. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from business conducted outside the U.S. and are subject to the risks of doing business outside the U.S.. <U+FEFF>. We face many risks inherent in conducting business activities outside the U.S. that, unless managed properly, may adversely affect our profitability, including our ability to collect amounts due from customers. While most of our operations outside the U.S. are conducted in highly developed countries, our operations could be adversely affected by, among others, the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnexpected changes in laws, regulations and policies of non-U.S. governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in regulatory requirements, including export controls, tariffs and embargoes, other trade restrictions, competition, corporate practices and data privacy concerns;. 14. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPolitical policies, political or civil unrest, terrorism or epidemics and other similar outbreaks;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFluctuations in currency exchange rates;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimited protection for the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights in some countries;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOperating in countries with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPotentially adverse changes in taxation;  and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOther factors, depending upon the specific country in which we conduct business.. <U+FEFF>. These uncertainties may make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately plan future business activities and may lead our customers in certain countries to delay purchases of our products and services. More generally, these geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in global financial markets and economies.. <U+FEFF>. The consequences of terrorism or armed conflicts are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our market opportunities or our business. We are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorism, acts of war and similar events.. <U+FEFF>. While the geographic areas outside the U.S. in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary, our foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from, among other things, certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated, for example, in U.S. dollars rather than their respective functional currencies.. <U+FEFF>. Moreover, our operations are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We seek to minimize these risks through regular operating and financing activities and, when we consider it to be appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. However, our efforts to minimize our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices may prove to be insufficient or unsuccessful.. <U+FEFF>. We depend on our supply chain for components and sub-assemblies used in our 3D printers and other products and for raw materials used in our materials. If these relationships were to terminate or be disrupted, our business could be disrupted while we locate alternative suppliers and our expenses may increase.. <U+FEFF>. We  have outsourced the assembly of certain of our printers to third party suppliers. In addition, we purchase components and sub-assemblies for our printers from third-party suppliers, and we purchase raw materials that are used in our materials, as well as certain of those materials, from third-party suppliers.. <U+FEFF>. While there are several potential suppliers of the components, parts and sub-assemblies for our products, we currently choose to use only one or a limited number of suppliers for several of these components, including our lasers, materials and certain jetting components. Our reliance on a single or limited number of suppliers involves many risks, including, among others, the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPotential shortages of some key components;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDisruptions in the operations of these suppliers;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tProduct performance shortfalls; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduced control over delivery schedules, assembly capabilities, quality and costs.. <U+FEFF>. While we believe that we can obtain all the components necessary for our products from other manufacturers, we require any new supplier to become \"qualified\" pursuant to our internal procedures, which could involve evaluation processes of varying durations. We generally have our printers and other products assembled based on our internal forecasts and the supply of raw materials, assemblies,. 15. components and finished goods from third parties, which are subject to various lead times.  In addition, at any time, certain suppliers may decide to discontinue production of an assembly, component or raw material that we use. Any unanticipated change in the sources of our supplies, or unanticipated supply limitations, could increase production or related costs and consequently reduce margins.. <U+FEFF>. If our forecasts exceed actual orders, we may hold large inventories of slow-moving or unusable parts, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. Inversely, we may lose orders if our forecast is low and we are unable to meet demand.. <U+FEFF>. We have engaged selected design and manufacturing companies to assemble certain of our production printers. In carrying out these outsourcing activities, we face a number of risks, including, among others, the following:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk that the parties that we retain to perform assembly activities may not perform in a satisfactory manner;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk of disruption in the supply of printers or other products to our customers if such third parties either fail to perform in a satisfactory manner or are unable to supply us with the quantity of printers or other products that are needed to meet then current customer demand; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe risk of insolvency of these suppliers, as well as the risks that we face, as discussed above, in dealing with a limited number of suppliers.. <U+FEFF>. Our products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin, product returns, product liability, warranty or other claims that could result in significant expenses and harm to our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. We sell complex hardware and software products, materials and services that can contain undetected design and manufacturing defects or errors when first introduced or as enhancements are released that, despite testing, are not discovered until after the product has been installed and used by customers. Sophisticated software and applications, such as those sold by us, may contain \"bugs\" that can unexpectedly interfere with the software's intended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products we purchase from third parties. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software, materials and services we sell. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, product returns, product liability, delayed market acceptance of those products and services, claims from distributors, end-users or others, increased end-user service and support costs, and significant warranty claims and other expenses to correct the defects, diversion of management time and attention and harm to our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. The costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or our subsidiaries, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. <U+FEFF>. We may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations, inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business, including those described in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict the outcome of these or any other legal matters.  In the future, we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters because our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. Our operations could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key management or other key employees.. <U+FEFF>. Our success depends upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our senior executive team is critical to the management of our business and operations, as well as to the development and execution of our strategy. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior executive team could delay or prevent the successful implementation of our growth strategy, or our commercialization of new applications for our systems or other products, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to manage our company effectively and carry out our business plan. Members of our senior management team may resign at any time. High demand exists for senior management and other key personnel (including scientific, technical and sales personnel) in the 3D printing industry, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain such personnel. We experience intense competition for qualified personnel.. <U+FEFF>. While we intend to continue to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel, some of our competitors for these employees have greater resources and more experience, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel. If we cannot attract and retain sufficiently qualified technical employees for our research and development and manufacturing operations, we may be unable to achieve the synergies expected from mergers and acquisitions that we may effect from time to time, or to develop. 16. and commercialize new products or new applications for existing products. Furthermore, possible shortages of key personnel, including engineers, in the regions surrounding our facilities could require us to pay more to hire and retain key personnel, thereby increasing our costs.. <U+FEFF>. We may be subject to product liability claims, which could result in material expense, diversion of management time and attention and damage to our business reputation.. <U+FEFF>. The sale and support of our products entails the risk of product liability claims. From time to time, we may become subject to product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses.  The risk may be heightened when we provide products into certain markets, such as healthcare, aerospace and automotive industries.. <U+FEFF>. This risk of product liability claims may also be greater due to the use of certain hazardous chemicals used in the production of certain of our products, including irritants, harmful chemicals and chemicals dangerous to the environment. We may also be subject to claims that our products have been, or may be used to, create parts that are not in compliance with legal requirements or that infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.. <U+FEFF>. We attempt to include provisions in our agreements with customers that are designed to limit our exposure to potential liability for damages arising from defects or errors in our products and other issues. However, the nature and extent of these limitations vary from customer to customer. Their effect is subject to a variety of legal limitations and it is possible that these limitations may not be effective as a result of unfavorable judicial decisions or laws enacted in the future.. <U+FEFF>. Any claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in significant expense, diversion of management time and attention, damage to our business reputation and failure to retain existing customers or to attract new customers. Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is subject to deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. Costs or payments made in connection with product liability claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We rely on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution and other key functions. If our information systems fail to adequately perform these functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.. <U+FEFF>. The efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely on our management information systems to, among other things, effectively manage our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; to manage our manufacturing and supply chain processes; and to maintain our research and development data. The failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt our business and product development, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our business and operating results to suffer. Although we take steps to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet and Internet sites, email and other telecommunications and data networks, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage and interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss or other disruptive events. Our reputation and financial condition could be adversely affected if, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shut down; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed; we incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources to system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.. <U+FEFF>. We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions and similar laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.. <U+FEFF>. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investments.. <U+FEFF>. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and United Kingdom Bribery Act (the \"Bribery Act\"), export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), the State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\"DDTC\") and the Bureau of Industry and Security (\"BIS\") of the Department of. 17. Commerce. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign customers, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.. <U+FEFF>. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA's prohibition on providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the provisions of the Bribery Act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in Brazil, China, India and developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.. <U+FEFF>. As an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\"ITAR\") administered by the DDTC, the Export Administration Regulations (\"EAR\") administered by the BIS and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by OFAC. The EAR governs products, parts, technology and software which present military or weapons proliferation concerns, so-called \"dual use\" items, and ITAR governs military items listed on the United States Munitions List. Prior to shipping certain items, we must obtain an export license or verify that license exemptions are available. Any failures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, and repeat failures could carry more significant penalties.. <U+FEFF>. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment and could harm our reputation, create negative shareholder sentiment and affect our share value. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs administered by OFAC, the DDTC and BIS, and have trained our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, persons and entities, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.. <U+FEFF>. We have received an administrative subpoena from the Bureau of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce requesting information related to possible violations of U.S. export control laws.. In October 2017, we received an administrative subpoena from the BIS requesting the production of records in connection with possible violations of U.S. export control laws, including with regard to our Quickparts.com, Inc. (\"Quickparts\") subsidiary. In addition, while collecting information responsive to the above-referenced subpoena, we identified potential violations of the ITAR administered by the DDTC and potential violations of the Export Administration Regulations administered by the BIS. On February 12, 2018, we submitted an initial notice of voluntary disclosure to DDTC in which we identified certain potentially unauthorized exports of technical data.  We are continuing to conduct an internal review and are cooperating fully with BIS and DDTC, but cannot at this time predict the ultimate resolution of this matter. We expect to incur significant legal costs and other expenses in connection with responding to these inquiries.. As noted above, if the U.S. government finds that we have violated one or more export control laws or trade sanctions, we could be subject to various penalties. By statute, these penalties can include but are not limited to fines, which may be significant, denial of export privileges, and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts; and any assessment of penalties could also harm our reputation, create negative investor sentiment, and affect the trading price of our common stock. In connection with any resolution, we may also be required to undertake additional remedial compliance measures and program monitoring.  We cannot at this time predict when BIS and/or DDTC will conclude their investigations or determine an estimated cost, if any, or range of costs, for any penalties or fines that may be incurred upon resolution of this matter.. <U+FEFF>. 18. Changes in, or interpretation of, tax rules and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and future profitability.. <U+FEFF>. We are a U.S. based, multinational company subject to taxation in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in statutory tax rates or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we do business, changes in the amount of revenue or earnings in the countries with varying statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") is one such example of recent legislation that impacts the effective rate and tax posture of the Company. For additional details see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, we are subject to audits and examinations of previously filed income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential impact of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that we expect may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there is no assurance that the final determination of any examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.. <U+FEFF>. Regulation in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security could increase our costs and affect or limit our business opportunities and how we collect and/or use personal information.. <U+FEFF>. As privacy, data protection and information security laws, including data localization laws, are interpreted and applied, compliance costs may increase, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place. In recent years, there has been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security in the U.S. and in various countries in which we operate.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, state and federal legislators and/or regulators in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, data protection and information security laws that potentially could have significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. New legislation or regulation could increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce revenues from certain business initiatives. Moreover, the application of existing or new laws to existing technology and practices can be uncertain and may lead to additional compliance risk and cost.. <U+FEFF>. Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws relating to consumer and/or employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring, customer attrition, decreases in the use or acceptance of our products and services and damage to our reputation and our brand.. <U+FEFF>. Our business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.. <U+FEFF>. Our business involves the blending, controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our suppliers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe the safety procedures we utilized for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, local, state, federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. If we are subject to any liability as a result of activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected and our reputation may be harmed.. <U+FEFF>. Our common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.. <U+FEFF>. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, considerable volatility. Between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $6.00 per share to a high of $23.70 per share. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including those described or referred to in this \"Risk Factors\" section of this Form 10-K, as well as, among other things:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur perceived value in the securities markets;. 19. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOverall trends in the stock market;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements of changes in our forecasted operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe impact of changes in our results of operations, our financial condition or our prospects;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuture sales of our common stock or other securities (including any shares issued in connection with earn-out obligations for any past or future acquisition);. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket conditions for providers of products and services such as ours;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExecutive level management uncertainty or change;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in recommendations or revenue or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAnnouncements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.. <U+FEFF>. Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.. <U+FEFF>. We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAuthorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSpecifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRequiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and. <U+FEFF>.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tControlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors.. <U+FEFF>. These provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.. <U+FEFF>. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.. <U+FEFF>"
