[1] "ITEM  1A.    RISK FACTORS. Our business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have generated only modest historical revenues, which makes it difficult to assess our future viability.. We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We have focused primarily on in-licensing and developing our product candidates. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in April 2009. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. There are many risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Three of our product candidates, CO-101, CO-1686 (rociletinib) and CO-3810 (lucitanib), encountered development and/or regulatory setbacks after initial promising data, leading us to discontinue enrollment in then-ongoing clinical trials. We have received regulatory approval to market Rubraca in the U.S., but we do not yet know whether it will be approved in other jurisdictions or whether it will achieve market acceptance and be commercially successful.  We have generated only modest revenues from product sales to date. We continue to incur. 29. Table of Contents. significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net losses of $346.4 million, $349.1 million and $352.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,447.4 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. As such, we are subject to all of the risks incident to the development of new biopharmaceutical products and related companion diagnostics, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, regulatory scrutiny, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if Rubraca or any of our product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders' equity and working capital.. We will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or continue our development programs.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial organizations to address certain markets.. Based on current estimates, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities will allow us to fund our operating plan through at least the next 12 months. We do not have any material committed external source of funds or other support for our development efforts.. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do in sufficient amounts, we expect to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances and other similar licensing arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, or our plans for acquisition or in-license of new product candidates. We may also seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.. Servicing our long-term debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.. In September 2014, we completed a private placement of $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the \"Notes\"), resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $278.3 million after deducting offering expenses. The Notes are governed by the terms of the indenture between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Interest is payable on the Notes semi-annually, and the Notes mature on September 15, 2021, unless redeemed, repurchased or converted prior to that date. In addition, if, as defined by the terms of the indenture, a fundamental change occurs, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of December 31, 2017, all $287.5 million principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding.. Our ability to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on the Notes, or to pay the repurchase price for the Notes on a fundamental change, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may not have sufficient cash in the future to service our debt. If we are unable to generate such cash flow or secure additional sources of funding, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. 30. Table of Contents. We and certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in several lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention.. We and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits that generally allege that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements regarding the progress toward FDA approval and the potential for market success of rociletinib.  Some of these lawsuits have been settled while others remain outstanding and others may still be brought.  See \"Part I, Item 3-Legal Proceedings\" in this report.. We intend to engage in a vigorous defense of these lawsuits; however, we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters at this time. If we are not successful in our defense of these litigation matters, we could be forced to make significant payments to, or enter into other settlements with, our security holders and their lawyers (and in certain circumstances reimburse costs and expenses incurred by the underwriters), and such payments or settlement arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, we could suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources from other priorities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any of these matters could require payments that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our available directors' and officers' liability insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.  We will not receive any further contributions from our insurance carriers for any amounts (including damages, settlement costs or legal fees) relating to the Company's regulatory update announcement in November 2015 that the FDA requested additional clinical data on the efficacy and safety of rociletinib.. Additional lawsuits with similar claims may be filed by other parties against us and our officers and directors. Even if such claims are not successful, these lawsuits or other future similar actions, or other regulatory inquiries or investigations, may result in substantial costs and have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.. The recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as \"orphan drugs\"). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. Investors should consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry. We are highly dependent on the commercial success of Rubraca in the U.S.; Rubraca may not achieve market acceptance and may not be commercially successful and we may not attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations.. On December 19, 2016, the FDA granted approval for Rubraca as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or somatic) associated advanced ovarian cancer, who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and selected for therapy based on an FDA approved companion diagnostic for Rubraca.  Our MAA submitted to the EMA for an ovarian cancer treatment indication is currently under review by the CHMP, and in February 2018, the CHMP communicated to us their intention to hold a final vote on the treatment indication at their. 31. Table of Contents. March 2018 meeting. Rubraca is commercially available in the U.S. The degree of market acceptance and the commercial success of Rubraca will depend on a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing strategy and operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to Rubraca and our commercial activities, including the post-marketing requirements and post-marketing commitments required by the FDA and, if approved in Europe, the EMA, to verify Rubraca's clinical benefit or safety by completing certain confirmatory trials, pharmacology studies and additional diagnostic development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe acceptance of Rubraca by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing products and therapies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe continued acceptable safety profile of Rubraca and the occurrence of any unexpected side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture commercial supplies of Rubraca, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with current good manufacturing practice (\"cGMP\") regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans, private health insurers and other third party payors and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for Rubraca;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe development or commercialization of competing products or therapies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarketing and distribution support for Rubraca, including the degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe actual market size for Rubraca, which may be different than expected;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to Rubraca;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize Rubraca in markets outside of the U.S.. As many of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate meaningful revenue through the sale of Rubraca. In addition, we may experience significant fluctuations in sales of Rubraca from period to period. We currently do not have any other product candidates in active development though we are exploring rucaparib in other indications. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Rubraca in the United States and any foreign territories where it may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and, ultimately, to generate sufficient revenues from Rubraca to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations.. Rubraca may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could limit its commercial potential.. If we or others identify previously unknown side effects or if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, then:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of Rubraca may decline;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory approvals for Rubraca may be restricted or withdrawn;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may decide to, or be required to, send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditional nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in labeling or changes to manufacturing processes, specifications and/or facilities may be required;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernment investigations or lawsuits, including class action suits, may be brought against us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation may suffer.. 32. Table of Contents. Any of the above occurrences would harm or prevent sales of Rubraca, increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize Rubraca. As Rubraca is commercially available, it may be used in a wider population and in a less rigorously controlled environment than in clinical studies. As a result, regulatory authorities, healthcare practitioners, third-party payors or patients may perceive or conclude that the use of Rubraca is associated with previously unknown serious adverse effects, undermining our commercialization efforts.. If our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca or our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval are inadequate, we may be unable to generate revenue from sales of our products.. Prior to the launch of Rubraca, we had not commercialized any drug products as a company. To achieve commercial success for Rubraca and any product candidate that may be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must continue to expand our sales, marketing, managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We will be competing with companies that currently have extensive, well-funded, and more experienced sales and marketing operations. We may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.. We have recently built a field organization and other capabilities for the sales, marketing and distribution of Rubraca in the United States and have hired the commercial infrastructure in the European Union, and there are significant risks involved with building and managing a sales organization. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to effectively commercialize Rubraca on our own include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of sales personnel to generate sufficient sales leads and to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to use or prescribe Rubraca;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team.. If we are unable to maintain effective sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca or if we are unable to establish and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for Rubraca outside of the United States, if approved, or for any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue or may not become profitable. If the cost of establishing and maintaining a sales and marketing organization exceeds the cost-effectiveness of doing so, we may not become profitable.. With respect to our product candidates, we may elect to collaborate with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems in certain territories. To the extent that we enter into licensing or co-promotion arrangements for any of our product candidates, our product revenue may be lower than if we directly marketed or sold our approved products. In addition, any revenue we receive as a result of such arrangements would depend in whole or in part upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful and are generally not within our control. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates that receive regulatory approval. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer and we may incur significant additional losses.. We cannot give any assurance that rucaparib will receive regulatory approval outside the United States or that the rucaparib development program in other lines of therapies and indications will be successful or that our other product candidates will receive regulatory approval.. To date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our product candidates. Our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates.. Each of our product candidates requires clinical development, management of clinical, non-clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization and significant marketing efforts in order to generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA. 33. Table of Contents. or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. To date, we have received regulatory approval from the FDA to market Rubraca in the United States for a certain limited indication. We may not receive similar regulatory approvals outside the United States and we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates. In addition, our product development programs contemplate the development of companion diagnostics by third-party collaborators. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation as medical devices and must themselves be approved for marketing by the FDA or certain other foreign regulatory agencies before our product candidates may be commercialized.. We cannot be certain that rucaparib will be successfully developed in other lines of therapy, tumor types or other indications or that any of our product candidates will be successful in clinical trials or receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. Three of our product candidates, CO-101, rociletinib and lucitanib encountered development and regulatory setbacks after initial promising data, leading us to discontinue enrollment in ongoing clinical trials. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon our diagnostic collaborators' ability to obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics to be used with our product candidates, as well as the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.. We plan to seek regulatory approval to commercialize our product candidates, and for other lines of therapies, indications or tumor types for rucaparib, in the United States, the European Union and in additional foreign countries. While the scope of regulatory approval is similar in other countries, obtaining separate regulatory approval in many other countries requires compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.. Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of non-clinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. It is not uncommon for companies in the biopharmaceutical industry to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Indeed, based on the negative results of a pivotal study, we ceased further development of our previous product candidate CO-101, and we decided to discontinue ongoing development of rociletinib as a result of the issuance of a Complete Response Letter by the FDA. Additionally, our future clinical trial results may not be successful.. Although we have clinical trials ongoing, we may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tobtaining institutional review board (\"IRB\") approval at each site;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdeveloping and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadding new clinical trial sites; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.. 34. Table of Contents. Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance.. We could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for rucaparib in other indications and lines of therapy or for our other product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have obtained regulatory approval for Rubraca in the United States for a specific indication, and it is possible that Rubraca may not obtain regulatory approval outside the United States or for broader indications and lines of therapy or other tumor types or that any of our other existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Indeed, with the issuance of a Complete Response Letter by the FDA with respect to the rociletinib NDA, we decided to discontinue ongoing development of rociletinib.. Our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval or approval may be delayed for many reasons, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from non-clinical studies or clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;. 35. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the companion diagnostics we contemplate developing with partners; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.. This lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.. Even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if and when approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal, and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our products.. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing and clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, pricing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices and good clinical practices for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefusal by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. All of the foregoing limitations, obligations, and requirements also apply to Rubraca, for which we have received regulatory approval in the United States for certain limited indications.. We may seek approval from U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities for one or more product candidates on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, we received accelerated approval from the FDA for the initial indication for Rubraca and are seeking conditional marketing authorization from the E.U. for rucaparib. Each of these approval pathways has certain conditions to approval, some of which may be post-approval, such as the conduct of a post-approval, or confirmatory, trial using due diligence. For example, continued approval of Rubraca by the FDA may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in ARIEL3 and/or ARIEL4, our confirmatory trials.  If we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that are conditions of a product's accelerated or conditional approval, if the confirmatory trial shows unfavorable results or increased or additional undesirable side effects, or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product candidate, the availability of accelerated or conditional approval may be withdrawn or our conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change a product candidate's labeled indications or even withdraw the product, if approved, from the market.. The FDA's and comparable foreign authorities' policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the. 36. Table of Contents. adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.. Rubraca and our other product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.. Adverse events (\"AEs\") attributable to our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Clinical studies conducted to date have generated AEs related to our product candidates, some of which have been serious. Patients treated with Rubraca have commonly experienced nausea, vomiting, constipation, dysgeusia, anemia/decreased hemoglobin, decreased appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia and fatigue/asthenia. In studies of lucitanib, hypertension, proteinuria and subclinical hypothyroidism requiring supplementation are the most common AEs observed. The most notable AEs experienced by patients treated with rociletinib include hyperglycemia and OTc prolongation. As is the case with all oncology drugs, it is possible that there may be other potentially harmful characteristics associated with their use in future trials, including larger and lengthier Phase III clinical trials. As we evaluate the use of our product candidates in combination with other active agents, we may encounter safety issues as a result of the combined safety profiles of each agent, which could pose a substantial challenge to that development strategy.. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related AEs could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.. Additionally, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.. Failure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics could harm our drug development strategy.. As one of the key elements of our clinical development strategy, we seek to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive selective and meaningful benefit from the product candidates we are developing. In collaboration with partners, we plan to develop companion diagnostics to help us to more accurately identify patients within a particular subset, both during our clinical trials and in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. We do not develop companion diagnostics internally and thus we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. We and our collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for the companion diagnostics, including issues relating to selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation. Any delay or failure by our. 37. Table of Contents. collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of the companion diagnostics could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates. In addition, our collaborators may encounter production difficulties that could constrain the supply of the companion diagnostics, and both they and we may have difficulties gaining acceptance of the use of the companion diagnostics in the clinical community. If such companion diagnostics fail to gain market acceptance, it would have an adverse effect on our ability to derive revenues from sales of our products. In addition, the diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of our product candidates or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of our product candidates.. We rely on third parties to conduct our non-clinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.. We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing non-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our non-clinical and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the EEA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under current GMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.. Our CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.. If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical and non-clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.. Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially influence our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.. 38. Table of Contents. We rely completely on third parties to manufacture our clinical drug supplies and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidate, and our commercialization of any of our product candidates could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain approval of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.. We do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our clinical drug supplies for use in the conduct of our clinical trials, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with the GMP regulatory requirements for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved.. We rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials. There are a limited number of suppliers of raw materials that we use to manufacture our drugs and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.. We are dependent on our third party manufacturers to conduct process development and scale-up work necessary to support greater clinical development and commercialization requirements for our product candidates. Carrying out these activities in a timely manner, and on commercially reasonable terms, is critical to the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. We expect that our third-party manufacturers are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated clinical and full-scale commercial demands, however if third parties with whom we currently work are unable to meet our supply requirements, we will need to secure alternate suppliers. While we believe that there are other contract manufacturers having the technical capabilities to manufacture our product candidates, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources would not result in significant delay or material additional costs.. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. While we have long-term agreements with Lonza for the manufacture of API for Rubraca and with the manufacturer of the finished drug product, we have not entered into agreements with any alternate suppliers. We currently obtain our supplies of finished drug product through individual purchase orders.. Our commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and major operators of cancer clinics.. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our other product candidates, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, health care payors, patients and the medical community, which are critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;. 39. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe clinical indications for which the drug is approved and the product label approved by regulatory authorities, including any warnings that may be required on the label;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments, especially with respect to patient subsets that we are targeting with such product candidate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost, safety and efficacy of the product in relation to alternative treatments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelative convenience and ease of administration;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.. If our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, and we may not become or remain profitable.. We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. In addition, the competition in the oncology market is intense. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions.. Lynparza\231 (olaparib) is approved in the U.S. as monotherapy in patients with germline BRCA mutated advanced ovarian cancer who have been treated with three or more prior lines of chemotherapy, as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy and as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting. Lynparza is also approved in the EU for the maintenance treatment of BRCA mutated platinum-sensitive relapsed serous ovarian cancer. In February 2018, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending this label be changed and expanded to remove the limitation of use in BRCA-mutated patients. Lynparza has indications for ovarian cancer across 57 countries (as of year-end 2017). In July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co., Inc. announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialise Lynparza for multiple cancer types. Lynparza is being investigated, alone and in combination with other agents, in multiple indications across several tumor types, including breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers.. Zejula/niraparib (Tesaro) was approved in March 2017 in the United States as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Zejula was approved in November 2017 in the EU for the same indication. Additional clinical investigations of Zejula in ovarian, breast and lung cancers are ongoing or planned. Janssen Biotech has licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in Japan.. There are a number of PARP inhibitors in clinical development including AbbVie's veliparib and ABT-767, Pfizer's talazoparib, BeiGene's BGB-290, and Checkpoint Therapeutics' CK-102. While most PARP inhibitor development focuses on ovarian, breast and prostate cancers, additional efforts are aimed toward bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers as well.. 40. Table of Contents. In addition, combination approaches that include PARP inhibitors, including Lynparza or Zejula, with other anticancer agents are in various phases of clinical development across a variety of oncology indications. These combination therapies may result in future competitive pressure on Rubraca, and multiple data readouts for such studies are anticipated throughout 2018 and beyond.. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop. If approved, our product candidates will face competition from commercially available drugs, as well as drugs that are in the development pipelines of our competitors and later enter the market.. Established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA, European Commission or other regulatory approval or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.. There is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. We have received approval for Rubraca in the United States for a limited indication. We intend to seek additional approvals to market Rubraca and other product candidates in the United States, Europe and other selected foreign jurisdictions. Market acceptance and sales of our product candidates in both domestic and international markets will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. These payors may conclude that our product candidates are less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing or later introduced products, and third-party payors may not approve our product candidates for coverage and reimbursement or may cease providing coverage and reimbursement for these product candidates.. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Even if we obtain coverage for our product candidates, third-party payors may not establish adequate reimbursement amounts, which may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. The U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. In particular, the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 revised the payment methodology for many products under the Medicare program in the United States. This has resulted in lower rates of reimbursement. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \"Affordable Care Act\"), was enacted. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Such government-adopted reform measures may adversely affect the pricing of. 41. Table of Contents. healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payors.. Moreover, payment methodologies, including payment for companion diagnostics, may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, the CMS has begun bundling the Medicare payments for certain laboratory tests ordered while a patient received services in a hospital outpatient setting and, in 2018, the CMS began paying for clinical laboratory services based on a weighted average of reported prices that private payors, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicaid Managed Care plans pay for laboratory services.. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as our ability to set satisfactory prices for our products, to generate revenues, and to achieve and maintain profitability.. In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such country.. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. Further, we will need to grow our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.. Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel, especially Patrick J. Mahaffy, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Lindsey Rolfe, our Executive Vice President of Clinical and Preclinical Development and Pharmacovigilance and Chief Medical Officer, Dale Hooks, our Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Gillian C. Ivers-Read, our Executive Vice President, Technical Operations and Chief Regulatory Officer, whose services are critical to the successful implementation of our product candidate acquisition, development and regulatory strategies.. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, development and commercial teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Pursuant to their employment arrangements, each of our executive officers may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time by providing as little as thirty days advance notice. Our employment arrangements with all of our employees provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or, other than our executive officers, without notice. For example, Andrew R. Allen, our former Executive Vice President of Clinical and Pre-Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer, resigned in July 2015, and Steven L. Hoerter, our former Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, resigned in January 2016 and Erle T. Mast, our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, resigned in March 2016. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel.. 42. Table of Contents. As of February 16, 2018, we employed 360 full-time employees. As our development plans and strategies develop, we expect to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects. If our management is unable to effectively manage our expected growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy.. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we have to offer. In order to induce valuable employees to continue their employment with us, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.. Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state health-care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Ethics and other compliance policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant effect on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.. Our relationships with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, customers (actual and potential) and third-party payors are and will continue to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency and disclosure (or \"sunshine\") laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.. Our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. These laws may affect, among other things, our current activities with clinical study investigators and research subjects, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing, disease awareness, and patient assistance programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate, directly. 43. Table of Contents. or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment will be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or special intent to violate the law in order to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil \"qui tam\" or \"whistleblower\" actions, against individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from federal programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also imposes certain requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's election of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a Federal or state governmental program;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal government price reporting laws, which require drug manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government agencies, including CMS, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on marketed products. Participation in these programs and compliance with the applicable requirements may result in potentially significant discounts on products subject to reimbursement under federal healthcare programs and increased infrastructure costs, and may potentially limit a drug manufacturer's ability to offer certain marketplace discounts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tanalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback, false claims, consumer protection and unfair competition laws which may apply to pharmaceutical business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements as well as submitting claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to file reports with states regarding pricing and marketing information, such as the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensations and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.. 44. Table of Contents. In addition, the research and development of our product candidates outside the United States, and any sales of our products or product candidates once commercialized outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs, including investments in infrastructure and additional resources. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our consulting agreements and other relationships with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Governmental and enforcement authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.. We face an inherent risk of product liability. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinjury to our reputation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinitiation of investigations by regulators;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts to defend the related litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta diversion of management's time and our resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease in insurance premiums;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenues from product sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta decline in our stock price.. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We have a program of product liability insurance covering our ongoing clinical trials; however, the amount of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any. 45. Table of Contents. amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.. Our internal computer systems, or those used by our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.. We and our business partners maintain sensitive company data on our computer networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary business information, as well as certain clinical trial information. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more commonplace and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of information and corruption of data. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in other foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Two oppositions were filed in the granted European counterpart of the rucaparib camsylate salt/polymorph patent on June 20, 2017. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is threatened, it could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. Furthermore, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"U.S. PTO\") to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.. In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United. 46. Table of Contents. States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our drug discovery and development efforts.. Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including interference, inter parties review and reexamination proceedings before the U.S. PTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others.. Third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There are or may be third-party patents with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy or patient selection methods, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license, limit our uses, or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, limit our uses, pay royalties or redesign our infringing product candidates, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.. The patent protection, patent prosecution and patent enforcement for some of our product candidates is dependent on third parties.. While we normally seek and gain the right to fully prosecute, maintain and enforce the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when platform technology patents that relate to our product candidates are controlled by our licensors. This is the case with the method of use patents licensed under the AstraZeneca license. This is also the case with our license to rociletinib, under which Celgene holds the right to prosecute and maintain the patents and patent applications covering its core discovery technology, including molecular backbones, building blocks and classes of compounds generated by that technology, aspects of which relate to rociletinib. We have the right to jointly prosecute and maintain, and the first right to enforce, the patent rights for the composition of matter for rociletinib. If AstraZeneca, Celgene or any of our future licensing partners fail to appropriately prosecute, maintain or enforce, as applicable, patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product. 47. Table of Contents. candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.. We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.. Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. PTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.. If we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to our product candidates from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.. We license the use, development and commercialization rights for all of our product candidates, and may enter into similar licenses in the future. Under each of our existing license agreements we are subject to commercialization and development, diligence obligations, milestone payment obligations, royalty payments and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach our license agreements, including by failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize the product candidate, our licensing partners may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part. Generally, the loss of any one of our licenses or other licenses in the future could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. 48. Table of Contents. Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.. The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe or our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.. Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.. Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock and Convertible Senior Notes. There may not be a viable public market for our common stock and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.. Our common stock had not been publicly traded prior to our initial public offering in November 2011. An active trading market for our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market may not be sustained. As a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares at a price that is attractive to you or at all. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration.. The price of our stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, the price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $39.83 per share to $99.45 per share. In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse results of regulatory actions or decisions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour failure to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated adverse results or delays in our clinical trials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;. 49. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our product candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved drug product or inability to do so at acceptable prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour dependence on third parties, including CMOS and CROs, as well as our partners that provide us with companion diagnostic products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to meet or exceed any financial guidance or expectations regarding development milestones that we may provide to the public;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall performance of the equity markets and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction of new products offered by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissuances of debt or equity securities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrading volume of our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tineffectiveness of our internal controls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral political and economic conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.. In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Select Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \"Risk Factors,\" could have a dramatic and material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. Because our outstanding Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of our Notes. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling in our common stock by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.. The conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders. Holders of the outstanding Notes are able to convert them at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2021. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive shares of common stock. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such Notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the. 50. Table of Contents. market price of our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities.. Following periods of volatility in a company's stock price, litigation has often been initiated against companies. Following the decline in our stock price related to the rociletinib regulatory update in November 2015, a number of lawsuits have been filed against us (see \"Part I, Item 3-Legal Proceedings\"). These proceedings and other similar litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.. Certain members of management and their affiliates own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.. Our executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates known to us beneficially owned approximately 6.7% of our voting stock as of February 21, 2018. These stockholders may have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. The interests of our executive officers, directors, and their affiliates might not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our capital stock which may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.. Shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.. Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.. We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.. Pursuant to our equity incentive plan(s), our compensation committee (or its designee) is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. As of December 31, 2017, the number of shares of our common stock available for future grant under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (\"2011 Plan\") is 3,147,903. The number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2011 Plan will be increased (i) from time to time by the number of shares of our common stock forfeited upon the expiration, cancellation, forfeiture, cash settlement or other termination of awards under our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, and (ii) at the discretion of our board of directors, on the date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, by up to the lesser of (x) a number of additional shares of our common stock representing 4% of our then-outstanding shares of common stock on such date and (y) 2,758,621 shares of our common stock. Future option and restricted stock unit, or RSU, grants and issuances of common stock under our 2011 Plan may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes.. Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management. These provisions include:. 51. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreating a staggered board of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpermitting our board of directors to accelerate the vesting of outstanding option grants upon certain transactions that result in a change of control; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. Additionally, certain provisions of our outstanding Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. The repurchase price of the Notes must be paid in cash, and this obligation may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to our security holders.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. We may not be able to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes.. If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture, prior to the maturity date of the Notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. We may not have or be able to borrow the funds required to repurchase the Notes on the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes may otherwise be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes when required.. We may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above; and we may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur.. 52. Table of Contents. We may incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in any debt instruments that we enter into in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture governing the Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the Notes when due. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, agreements that govern any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our debt."
