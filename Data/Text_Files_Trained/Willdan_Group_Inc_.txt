[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry. We operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. Set forth below are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results and expectations contained in this report. Additional risks we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. 17. Table of Contents. If we fail to complete a project in a timely manner, miss a required performance standard, or otherwise fail to adequately perform on a project, then we may incur a loss on that project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability.. Our engagements often involve large - scale, complex projects. The quality of our performance on such projects depends in large part upon our ability to manage the relationship with our clients and our ability to effectively manage the project and deploy appropriate resources, including third - party contractors and our own personnel, in a timely manner. We may commit to a client that we will complete a project by a scheduled date or that, when completed, a project will achieve specified performance standards. For instance, we may fail to achieve energy savings requirements that are stipulated in our contracts. If the project is not completed by the scheduled date or fails to meet required performance standards, we may either incur significant additional costs or be held responsible for the costs incurred by the client to rectify damages due to late completion or failure to achieve the required performance standards. The uncertainty of the timing of a project can present difficulties in planning the amount of personnel needed for the project. If the project is delayed or canceled, we may bear the cost of an underutilized workforce that was dedicated to fulfilling the project. In addition, performance of projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including unavoidable delays from government inaction, public opposition, inability to obtain financing, weather conditions, unavailability of vendor materials, changes in the project scope of services requested by our clients, industrial accidents, environmental hazards, and labor disruptions. To the extent these events occur, the total costs of the project could exceed our estimates, and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, incur a loss on a project, which may reduce or eliminate our overall profitability. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our clients' expectations, could result in claims for damages against us. Failure to meet performance standards or complete performance on a timely basis could also adversely affect our reputation.. The energy efficiency services market is highly competitive and if we are unable to compete successfully our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.. The energy efficiency services market is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase and intensify as the energy efficiency services market continues to evolve. We face strong competition primarily from other providers of energy efficiency services, local electrical and mechanical contractors and engineering firms, lighting and lighting fixture manufacturers and lighting fixture distributors. We compete primarily on the basis of client service and support, quality and scope of services and products, including proprietary technology, cost of services and products, name recognition and our performance track record for services provided.. In addition to our existing competitors, new competitors such as large national or multinational engineering and/or construction companies could enter our markets.  Many of these current and potential competitors are better capitalized than we are, have longer operating histories and strong existing client relationships, greater name recognition, and more extensive engineering, technology and sales and marketing capabilities. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy efficiency services that may be potentially more attractive to clients than our products or services. In addition, we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity. Our competitors may also offer energy efficiency services at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain clients, require us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive, and reduce our revenue and profitability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We are more susceptible to risks relating to the energy efficiency services industry, which represented 73% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2017, than we have been in the past and a loss of customers or other downturn in demand for those services could have a material impact on our revenues, profitability and financial condition.. Revenue generated from our Energy Efficiency Services segment has continued to increase, from 49% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2014 to 73% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal year 2017.  This increase is due primarily to an increase in demand for these services as well as acquisitions we have made in this segment in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017.  A loss of customers or other downturn in demand could have a material adverse impact on our. 18. Table of Contents. business, results of operations and financial condition.  To address risks related to increased dependence on the energy efficiency services business, we must do the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMaintain and expand our current utility relationships and develop new relationships;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMaintain, enhance and add to our existing energy efficiency services; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExecute our business and marketing strategies successfully; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAchieve the energy savings that are specified in our contracts.. If we are unable to accomplish these objectives and we suffer a downturn in business from energy efficiency services, we may not be able to supplement the loss of revenue from our other services and it may result in lower revenues and have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our top two clients accounted for 38% consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2017, and if we have a loss or reduction of business from either of them, it could result in significant harm to our revenue, profitability and financial condition.. For fiscal year 2017, our top two clients accounted for 38% of our consolidated contract revenue.  Consolidated Edison and DASNY accounted for 16% and 22%, respectively, of our consolidated contract revenue in fiscal year 2017. These clients are not committed to purchase any minimum amount of our services, as our agreements with them are based on a \"purchase order\" model. As a result, they may discontinue utilizing some or all of our services with little or no notice.. The loss of either of these customers (or financial difficulties at either of these customers, which result in nonpayment or nonperformance) could have a significant and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We expect these two customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. If these clients significantly reduce their business or orders with us, default on their agreements with us or fail to renew or terminate their agreements with us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to win new contracts to replace these contracts if they are terminated early or expire as planned without being renewed.. In addition, the potential for requests from certain clients, including Consolidated Edison and DASNY, to significantly increase the services we provide them requires us to have sufficient resource capacity available in the regions where they are located. If we are unable to maintain such resource capacity, these clients may reduce or stop purchasing certain services from us. If such clients reduce or stop purchasing certain services from us, we may have substantial capacity available in regions where we do not have corresponding clients to service.. Changes to tax laws and regulations, including changes to the energy efficient building deduction, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation, and the tax laws and regulations to which we are subject change over time. Our tax filings are based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various jurisdictions for the periods for which the filings are made. As our business grows, we are required to comply with increasingly complex taxation rules and practices. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions. Changes in federal, state and local tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Changes in federal, state and local tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. On December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted into law. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, restricts the deductibility of certain business expenses, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from U.S. tax and creates new U.S. taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings, among other provisions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, which is the period of. 19. Table of Contents. enactment, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Act and recognized a provisional decrease in deferred tax expense of $1.3 million. This provisional amount is based on management's current knowledge and assumptions. Final amounts could be materially different from current estimates based on further analysis of the tax law changes or on additional guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"), the SEC, or the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\").. Shortly after the Tax Act was enacted, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and directing taxpayers to consider the impact of the Tax Act as \"provisional\" when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the change in tax law.  In accordance with SAB 118, we have recognized the provisional tax impacts.  Although, we do not believe there will be any material adjustments in subsequent reporting periods, the ultimate impact may differ from the provisional amounts, due to, among other things, the limitation on the deductibility of certain executives' compensation pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Internal Revenue Code\"), a detailed evaluation of the contractual terms of our fourth quarter 2017 capital additions to determine whether they qualify for the 100% expensing pursuant to the Tax Act, the significant complexity of the Tax Act and anticipated additional regulatory guidance that may be issued by the IRS and changes in analysis, interpretations and assumptions we have made and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.  The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018.. A number of factors may impact our future effective income tax rate, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental authorities increasing taxes or eliminating deductions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the jurisdictions in which earnings are taxed;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in available tax credits;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in stock-based compensation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother changes in tax laws and regulations, and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe interpretation of tax laws and/or administrative practices.. For example, we utilized the energy efficient building deduction under Section 179D of the Internal Revenue Code, in fiscal years 2015 and 2016.  However, we were not able to utilize the energy efficient building deduction in the fiscal year 2017 tax provision due to Congress not enacting an extension of this deduction for tax year 2017 until the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.  The inability to utilize such deduction in fiscal year 2017 did not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we will claim this deduction on our 2017 federal tax return when filed in fiscal year 2018 and record a benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.. 20. Table of Contents. Any significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods.. A downturn in public and private sector construction activity in the regions we serve, or other conditions that impact the construction industry, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. A downturn in construction activity in our geographic service areas may affect demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal year 2017, a portion of our contract revenue was generated by services rendered to public agencies in connection with private and public sector construction projects.. In the recent past, general economic conditions declined due to a number of factors including slower economic activity, a lack of available credit, decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending, leading to a slowdown in construction, particularly residential housing construction, in the western United States. As a result of this slowdown, both our Engineering Services segment and Public Finance Services segment suffered declines in revenue and operating margin compression and we made several reductions in workforce and facility leases. While economic conditions have improved over the last several years, the recovery has been slow with regard to our traditional Engineering Services and Public Finance Services segments. If the economy declines again, we will need to evaluate whether reductions in headcount and facilities in geographic areas that are underperforming are again needed.. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected by conditions that impact the construction sector in general, including, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in national and local market conditions due to changes in general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSlow - growth or no - growth initiatives or legislation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse changes in local and regional governmental policies on investment in infrastructure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse changes in federal and state policies regarding the allocation of funds to local and regional agencies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws and other regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in real estate tax rates and assessments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreases in interest rates and changes in the availability, cost and terms of financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse changes in other governmental rules and fiscal policies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tEarthquakes and other natural disasters, which can cause uninsured losses, and other factors which are beyond our control.. Any of these factors could adversely affect the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Improper disclosure of confidential and personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.. We store and process increasingly large amounts of confidential information concerning our employees, customers and vendors, as well as confidential information on behalf of our customers (such as information regarding. 21. Table of Contents. applicants in programs on which we perform services through our contractual relationships with customers). Therefore, we must ensure that we are at all times compliant with various privacy laws, rules, and regulations. The risk of failing to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations increases as we continue to expand. Moreover, we must ensure that all of our vendors who have access to such information also have the appropriate privacy policies, procedures and protections in place.. Although we take appropriate measures to protect such information, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches of other companies provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving, and we face the constant risk of cybersecurity threats, including computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and/or corruption of data. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure from customers, or subject us to liability under laws, rules and regulations that protect personal or other confidential data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls. Despite these efforts, it is possible that our security controls over data, our training, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable or other confidential information.. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns. If economic growth slows, government fiscal conditions worsen, or client spending declines further, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, changes in the local and regional economies of New York and California could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Demand for our services is cyclical, and vulnerable to economic downturns and reductions in government and private industry spending. Such downturns or reductions may result in clients delaying, curtailing or canceling proposed and existing projects. Our business traditionally lags the overall recovery in the economy; therefore, our business may not recover immediately when the economy improves. If economic growth slows, government fiscal conditions worsen, or client spending declines, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding new or existing projects. In addition, our existing and potential clients may either postpone entering into new contracts or request price concessions. Difficult financing and economic conditions may cause some of our clients to demand better pricing terms or delay payments for services we perform, thereby increasing the average number of days our receivables are outstanding, and the potential of increased credit losses of uncollectible invoices. Further, these conditions may result in the inability of some of our clients to pay us for services that we have already performed. If we are not able to reduce our costs quickly enough to respond to the revenue decline from these clients, our operating results may be adversely affected. Accordingly, these factors affect our ability to forecast our future revenue and earnings from business areas that may be adversely impacted by market conditions.. In particular, adverse economic and other conditions affecting the local and regional economies of New York and California may reduce the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal year 2017, approximately 46% and 30% of our contract revenue was derived from services rendered to public agencies, utilities, and private industry in New York and California, respectively. New York and California each experienced an economic downturn in fiscal year 2009, which negatively impacted our revenue and profitability. Any future downturns could have similar significant adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our contracts may contain provisions that are unfavorable to us and permit our clients to, among other things, terminate our contracts partially or completely at any time prior to completion.. Certain of our contracts contain provisions that allow our clients to terminate or modify the contract at their convenience upon short notice. For example, Consolidated Edison and DASNY, our two largest sources of revenue, may terminate their respective contracts with us at any time for any reason. If a client terminates one of our contracts for convenience, we may only bill the client for work completed prior to the termination, plus any commitments and. 22. Table of Contents. settlement expenses the client agrees to pay, but not for any work not yet performed. In addition, many of our government contracts and task and delivery orders are incrementally funded as appropriated funds become available. The reduction or elimination of such funding can result in contract options not being exercised and further work on existing contracts and orders being curtailed. In any such event, we would have no right to seek lost fees or other damages. If a client were to terminate, decline to exercise options under, or curtail further performance under one or more of our major contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We often rely on subcontractors. The quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts would be adversely affected if qualified subcontractors are unavailable for us to engage.. Under some of our contracts, we rely on the efforts and skills of subcontractors for the performance of some of the tasks. Subcontractor services and other direct costs comprised approximately 56% and 50% of our contract revenue in fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our use of subcontractors has increased in recent years primarily because of our acquisitions of Abacus and substantially all of the assets of 360 Energy and Genesys in our energy efficiency services business.  Our subsidiary WES generally utilizes a higher percentage of subcontractors than our other subsidiaries. The absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service offerings and therefore, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or client concerns about the subcontractor.. Our failure to win new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector clients could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our business depends on our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector clients. Contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process. If we are not able to replace the revenue from expiring contracts, either through follow-on contracts or new contracts, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. A number of factors affect our ability to win new contracts and renew existing contracts, including, market conditions, financing arrangements, required governmental approvals, our client relationships and professional reputation.  For example, a client may require us to provide a bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract.  If negative market conditions arise, or if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or the required government approval, we may not be able to pursue particular projects, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Any factor that diminishes our reputation or client relationships with federal, state and local governments, as well as commercial clients, could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for both new engagements and qualified employees. To the extent our reputation and/or client relationships deteriorate, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. We derive significant revenue and profit from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process, which can impose substantial costs on us, and we will lose revenue and profit if we fail to compete effectively.. We derive significant revenue and profit from contracts that are awarded through a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding, as discussed below; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we may have otherwise pursued.. 23. Table of Contents. To the extent we engage in competitive bidding and are unable to win particular contracts, we not only incur substantial costs in the bidding process that negatively affect our operating results, but we may lose the opportunity to operate in the market for the services provided under those contracts for a number of years. Even if we win a particular contract through competitive bidding, our profit margins may be depressed or we may even suffer losses as a result of the costs incurred through the bidding process and the need to lower our prices to overcome competition.. Reductions in state and local government budgets could negatively impact their capital spending and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our state and local government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding new or existing projects. In addition, existing and potential clients may either postpone entering into new contracts or request price concessions. If we are not able to reduce our costs quickly enough to respond to the revenue decline from these clients that may occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. Accordingly, these factors affect our ability to accurately forecast our future revenue and earnings from business areas that may be adversely impacted by market conditions.. Because we primarily provide services to municipalities, public utilities and other public agencies, we are more susceptible to the unique risks associated with government contracts.. We primarily work for utilities, municipalities and other public agencies. Consequently, we are exposed to certain risks associated with public agency and government contracting, any one of which can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe ability of the public agency to terminate the contract with 30 days' prior notice or less;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in public agency spending and fiscal policies which can have an adverse effect on demand for our services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tContracts that are subject to public agency budget cycles, and often are subject to renewal on an annual basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe often wide variation of the types and pricing terms of contracts from agency to agency;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe difficulty of obtaining change orders and additions to contracts; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe requirement to perform periodic audits as a condition of certain contract arrangements.. Each year, client funding for some of our government contracts may rely on government appropriations or public - supported financing. If adequate public funding is delayed or is not available, then our profits and revenue could decline.. Each year, client funding for some of our government contracts may directly or indirectly rely on government appropriations or public - supported financing. Legislatures may appropriate funds for a given project on a year - by - year basis, even though the project may take more than one year to perform. In addition, public - supported financing such as state and local municipal bonds may be only partially raised to support existing projects. Similarly, the impact of the economic downturn on state and local governments may make it more difficult for them to fund projects. In addition to the state of the economy and competing political priorities, public funds and the timing of payment of these funds may be influenced by, among other things, curtailments in the use of government contracting firms, increases in raw material costs, delays associated with insufficient numbers of government staff to oversee contracts, budget constraints, the timing and amount of tax receipts, and the overall level of government expenditures. If adequate public funding is not available or is delayed, then our profits and revenue could decline.. 24. Table of Contents. We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to conduct due diligence effectively, or our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions, which could weaken our results of operations.. A key part of our growth strategy, as shown by our July 2017 acquisition of Integral Analytics, our March 2016 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Genesys and our January 2015 acquisitions of Abacus and substantially all of the assets of 360 Energy, is to acquire other companies that complement our lines of business or that broaden our technical capabilities and geographic presence. We may continue to acquire companies as an element of our growth strategy; however, our ability to make acquisitions is restricted under our amended credit agreement. Acquisitions involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts. For example:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to acquire additional companies on acceptable terms;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe compete with others to acquire companies, which may result in decreased availability of, or increased price for, suitable acquisition candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition even if we announce that we plan to acquire a company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquired companies may not perform as we expect, and we may fail to realize anticipated revenue and profits.. Our acquisition strategy may divert management's attention away from our existing businesses, resulting in the loss of key clients or key employees, and expose us to unanticipated problems or legal liabilities, including responsibility as a successor-in-interest for undisclosed or contingent liabilities of acquired businesses or assets.. If we fail to conduct due diligence on our potential targets effectively, we may, for example, not identify problems at target companies, or fail to recognize incompatibilities or other obstacles to successful integration. Our inability to successfully integrate future acquisitions could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of those acquisitions and could severely weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissues in integrating information, communications and other systems;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincompatibility of logistics, marketing and administration methods;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmaintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegrating the business cultures of both companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpreserving important strategic client relationships;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcoordinating and integrating geographically separate organizations.. 25. Table of Contents. Even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.. Further, acquisitions may cause us to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders' ownership percentage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuse a substantial portion of our cash resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements (if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassume liabilities, including environmental liabilities, for which we do not have indemnification from the former owners. Further, indemnification obligations may be subject to dispute or concerns regarding the creditworthiness of the former owners;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texperience volatility in earnings due to changes in contingent consideration related to acquisition earn-out liability estimates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlose existing or potential contracts as a result of conflict of interest issues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur large and immediate write-offs; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbecome subject to litigation.. If we are not able to successfully manage our growth strategy, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. Our expected future growth presents numerous managerial, administrative, operational, and other challenges. Our ability to manage the growth of our operations will require us to continue to improve our management information systems and our other internal systems and controls. In addition, our growth will increase our need to attract, develop, motivate, and retain both our management and professional employees. The inability to effectively manage our growth or the inability of our employees to achieve anticipated performance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Moreover, our continued expansion into new states will increase our legal and regulatory risk. Our failure, or alleged failure, to comply with applicable laws and regulations in any new jurisdiction in which we operate, and ensuing inquiries or investigations by regulatory and enforcement authorities, may result in regulatory action, including suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses, civil or criminal penalties or other disciplinary actions and restrictions on or suspension of some or all of our business operations. As a result, our business could suffer, our reputation could be harmed, one or more of our contracts with governmental or non-governmental entities could be terminated and we could be subject to additional legal risk. This could, in turn, increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against us, subject us to additional regulatory investigations, enforcement actions or other proceedings or lead to increased regulatory or supervisory concerns. We may also be required to spend additional time and resources on any necessary remedial measures. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these challenges. We cannot predict the timing or form of any current or future regulatory or law enforcement initiatives, and any such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 26. Table of Contents. The Integral Analytics business may underperform relative to our expectations.. We may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and Integral Analytics have achieved or might achieve separately. The business and financial performance of Integral Analytics are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may be unable to achieve the same growth, revenues and profitability that Integral Analytics has achieved in the past.. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, then our profits may be significantly reduced.. Because we have recently completed a number of acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets.  As of December 29, 2017, our goodwill was $38.2 million and other intangible assets were $10.7 million.  We are required to perform a goodwill impairment test for potential impairment at least on an annual basis.  We also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations.  The goodwill impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of our reporting units, which are the components at or one level below our reportable segments. In determining fair value, we make significant judgments and estimates, including assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations.  We also analyze current economic indicators and market valuations to help determine fair value.  To the extent economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change, our goodwill may be deemed to be impaired, and we would be required to record a non-cash charge that could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If our contractors and subcontractors fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or if we are unable to maintain these relationships, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. We depend on contractors and subcontractors in conducting our business. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, client concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to deliver on a timely basis the agreed - upon supplies, fails to perform the agreed - upon services, or goes out of business, then we may be required to purchase the services or supplies from another source at a higher price, and our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized. This may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services or supplies are needed.. We also rely on relationships with other contractors when we act as their subcontractor or joint venture partner. The absence of qualified subcontractors with which we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their subcontracts or teaming arrangement relationships with us, or if a government agency terminates or reduces these other contractors' programs, does not award them new contracts, or refuses to pay under a contract.. We may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders, which may impact our ability to execute on our current or future business strategies.. We anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and borrowing ability under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes during the next 12 months. It is possible, however, that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs.. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise, we may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies, including hiring additional personnel, developing new or enhancing existing service lines, expanding our business geographically, enhancing our operating infrastructure, acquiring complementary businesses, or otherwise responding to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the. 27. Table of Contents. issuance of convertible debt or equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, meet obligations in the normal course of business, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.. Restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue certain business strategies.. Our credit agreement limits or restricts our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens securing debt or other encumbrances on our assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake loans or advances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpurchase or redeem our stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepay indebtedness that is junior to indebtedness under our credit agreement;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquire the assets of, or merge or consolidate with, other companies; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell, lease, or otherwise dispose of assets.. Our credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, which we may not be able to achieve.  The covenants may impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other favorable business activities. Failing to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement, which could result in us being required to repay the amounts outstanding thereunder prior to maturity. These prepayment obligations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our actual business and financial results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.. To prepare financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we typically recognize revenue of our fixed price contracts over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe application of the percentage - of - completion method of accounting and revenue recognition on contracts, change orders, and contract claims, including related unbilled accounts receivable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunbilled accounts receivable, including amounts related to requests for equitable adjustment to contracts that provide for price redetermination, primarily with the U.S. federal government. These amounts are recorded only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovisions for uncollectible receivables, client claims, and recoveries of costs from subcontractors, vendors, and others;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovisions for income taxes, valuation allowances, and unrecognized tax benefits;. 28. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvalue of goodwill and recoverability of other intangible assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvaluations of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvaluation of contingent earn - out liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvaluation of stock - based compensation expense; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves.. Our actual business and financial results could differ from those estimates, which may significantly reduce or eliminate our profits.. We are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits and investigations, and unfavorable government audit results could force us to adjust previously reported operating results, could affect future operating results, and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions.. Government departments and agencies audit and review our contract performance, pricing practices, cost structure, financial capability and compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Audits could raise issues that have significant adverse effects, including, but not limited to, substantial adjustments to our previously reported operating results and substantial effects on future operating results. If a government audit, review or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, repayment of amounts already received under contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with federal and state and local government agencies and departments, any of which could adversely affect our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition, and/or the value of our stock. We may also lose business if we are found not to be sufficiently able to meet ongoing cash flow and financial obligations on a timely basis. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation and our stock price could decline if allegations of impropriety are made against us, whether true or not.. Our profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain adequate utilization of our workforce.. The cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to manage attrition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development, and other non - chargeable activities; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to match the skill sets of our employees to the needs of the marketplace.. If we over - utilize our workforce, our employees may become disengaged, which could impact employee attrition. If we under - utilize our workforce, our profit margin and profitability could suffer.. 29. Table of Contents. Legislation, policy, rules or regulations may be enacted that limit or change the ability of state, regional or local agencies to contract for our privatized services. Such changes would affect our ability to obtain new contracts and may decrease the demand for our services.. Legislation is proposed periodically, particularly in the states of New York and California, that attempts to limit the ability of governmental agencies to contract with private consultants to provide services. Should such changes occur and be upheld, demand for our services may be materially adversely affected. During fiscal year 2017, approximately 85% of our contract revenue was derived from services rendered to public agencies, including public utilities. While attempts at such legislation have failed in the past, such measures could be adopted in the future.. Changes in energy, environmental, or infrastructure industry laws, regulations, and programs could directly or indirectly reduce the demand for our services, which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.. Some of our services are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in U.S. federal, state, or local laws and regulations pertaining to the energy, environmental, and infrastructure industries.  Accordingly, a relaxation or repeal of these laws and regulations, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of these programs, could result in a decline in demand for our services, which could in turn negatively impact our revenue.. State and other public employee unions may bring litigation that seeks to limit the ability of public agencies to contract with private firms to perform government employee functions in the area of public improvements. Judicial determinations in favor of these unions could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. For more than 20 years, state and other public employee unions have challenged the validity of propositions, legislation, charters and other government regulations that allow public agencies to contract with private firms to provide services in the fields of engineering, design and construction of public improvements that might otherwise be provided by public employees. These challenges could have the effect of eliminating, or severely restricting, the ability of municipalities to hire private firms for the purpose of designing and constructing public improvements, and otherwise require them to use union employees to perform the services.. For example, the Professional Engineers in California Government, or PECG, a union representing state civil service employees, began challenging Caltrans' hiring of private firms in 1986, and in 2002 began a judicial challenge of Caltrans' hiring practices based on Caltrans' interpretation of the effect of Proposition 35 (Professional Engineers in California Government, et al. v. Kempton). The California Supreme Court ruled in favor of Caltrans, concluding that Caltrans may hire private contractors to perform architectural and engineering services on public works. Although Caltrans was successful in this litigation, similar claims may be brought in the future and we cannot predict their outcome. If a state or other public employee union is successful in its challenge and as a result the ability of state agencies to hire private firms is severely limited, such a decision would likely lead to additional litigation challenging the ability of the state, counties, municipalities and other public agencies to hire private engineering, architectural and other firms, the outcome of which could affect our ability to compete for contracts and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Changes in elected or appointed officials could have a material adverse effect on our ability to retain an existing contract with or obtain additional contracts from a public agency.. Since the decision to retain our services is made by individuals, such as city managers, city councils and other elected or appointed officials, our business and financial results or condition could be adversely affected by the results of local and regional elections. A change in the individuals responsible for selecting consultants for and awarding contracts on behalf of a public agency due to an election could adversely affect our ability to retain an existing contract with or obtain additional contracts from such public agency.. 30. Table of Contents. Fixed price contracts under which we perform some of our services impose risks to our ability to maintain or grow our profitability.. In fiscal year 2017, approximately 49% of our contract revenue was derived from fixed price contracts. Under fixed price contracts, we perform services under a contract at a stipulated price which protects clients but exposes us to a greater number of risks than time - and - materials and unit - based contracts. We realize a profit on fixed price contracts only if we can control our costs and prevent cost overruns on our contracts. Fixed price contracts require cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, costs, and availability of labor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. We could experience cost overruns if these estimates are inaccurate as a result of errors or ambiguities in the contract specifications, or become inaccurate as a result of a change in circumstances following the submission of the estimate due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, or the inability of our vendors or subcontractors to perform. If cost overruns occur, we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. If a project is significant, or if there are one or more common issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could increase the unpredictability of our earnings, as well as have an adverse impact on business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our use of the percentage - of - completion method of revenue recognition on our fixed price contracts could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue and profits.. We account for our fixed price contracts on the percentage - of - completion method of revenue recognition. Generally, our use of this method results in recognition of revenue and profit ratably over the life of the contract, based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effects of revisions to revenue and estimated costs, including the achievement of award fees and the impact of change orders and claims, are recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long - term contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profit.. Changes in the perceived risk of acts of terrorism or natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Homeland Security Services business.. If there is a significant decrease in the perceived risk of the likelihood that one or more acts of terrorism will be conducted in the United States, or a significant decrease in the perceived risk of the occurrence of natural disasters, our ability to grow and generate revenue through our Homeland Security Services segment, could be negatively affected. Our Homeland Security Services segment provides training and consulting services to local and regional agencies related to preparing for and responding to incidents of terrorism and natural disaster. Should the perceived risk of such incidence decline, federal and state funding for homeland security and emergency preparedness could be reduced, which might decrease demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition of our Homeland Security Services business.. The loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and otherwise conduct our business effectively.. As primarily a professional and technical services company, we are labor - intensive and, therefore, our ability to attract, retain, and expand our senior management and our professional and technical staff is an important factor in determining our future success. The market for qualified engineers is competitive and, from time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the required expertise within the timeframe demanded by our clients. In addition, we rely heavily upon the expertise and leadership of our senior management. If we are unable to retain executives and other key personnel, the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify, hire, and integrate new employees. The loss of the services of any of these key personnel could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain key-man life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or senior managers. Our failure to attract and retain key individuals could impair our ability to provide services to our clients and conduct our business effectively.. 31. Table of Contents. We operate in a highly fragmented industry, and we may not be able to compete effectively with our larger competitors.. The market for energy efficiency and sustainability, engineering, construction management and planning, economic and financial consulting and national preparedness and interoperability services is competitive and highly fragmented. Contract awards are based primarily on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability and price. Some of our competitors in certain service areas have more personnel and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. In particular, our energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services, which represented approximately 73% and 68% of our contract revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, competes with larger energy efficiency consulting firms such as Lockheed - Martin Corp., EnerPath Services, Inc., KEMA Laboratories (a division of the DNV GL Group AS), CLEAResult Consulting, Inc., AM Conservation Group, Inc., Ameresco, Inc., Lime Energy Co., ICF International, Inc., and Nexant, Inc. Our competitors for engineering related services, which represented approximately 21% and 25% of our contract revenue for fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, include many larger consulting firms such as Charles Abbott & Associates, Inc., Harris & Associates, Inc., RBF Consulting, Inc., Tetra Tech, Inc., Stantec, Inc., Michael Baker Corporation, TRC Companies, Inc., AECOM Technology Corporation, NV5 Holdings, Inc., Ecology & Environment, Inc., Iteris, Inc., Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc., Kleinfelder, Inc., HNTB Corporation, and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. In certain public finance consulting services, we may compete with large accounting firms. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with these or other competitors.. Our services may expose us to liability in excess of our current insurance coverage, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.. Our services involve significant risks of professional and other liabilities, which may substantially exceed the fees we derive from our services. In addition, from time to time, we assume liabilities as a result of indemnification provisions contained in our service contracts. We cannot predict the magnitude of these potential liabilities.. We are liable to pay these claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. We are liable to pay claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits. Our professional liability policy is a \"claims made\" policy. Thus, only claims made during the term of the policy are covered. If we terminate our professional liability policy and do not obtain retroactive coverage, we would be uninsured for claims made after termination even if these claims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy. Further, our insurance may not protect us against liability because our policies typically have various exceptions to the claims covered and also require us to assume some costs of the claim even though a portion of the claim may be covered. In addition, if we expand into new markets, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage for these new activities or, if insurance is obtained, the dollar amount of any liabilities incurred could exceed our insurance coverage. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.. Unavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage would increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations.. We maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits.  If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage, or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted.  In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits.. Product liability and personal injury claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We face exposure to product liability and personal injury claims in the event that our services cause bodily injury or property damage.  Since the majority of our products use electricity, it is possible that the products we use. 32. Table of Contents. could result in injury, whether due to product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Further, we face exposure to personal injury claims in the event that an individual is injured because of our negligence or the negligence of one of our subcontractors.  Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. A successful product liability or personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials and at times requires that our contractors or subcontractors work in hazardous conditions, either of which could give rise to a claim against us.. When we retrofit a client's facility, we assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We utilize licensed and insured hazardous waste disposal companies to remove and/or dispose of such components. Failure to properly handle, remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability against us, or could expose our workers, our subcontractor's workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us.  Further, our workers and subcontractor's workers are sometimes required to work in hazardous environments that present a risk of serious personal injury, which could result in claims against us.  A successful personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. If our business partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project, we could be exposed to legal liability, loss of reputation and profit reduction or loss on the project.. We routinely enter into subcontracts and, occasionally, joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and other contractual arrangements so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project.  Success under these arrangements depends in large part on whether our business partners fulfill their contractual obligations satisfactorily.  In addition, when we operate through a joint venture in which we are a minority holder, we have limited control over many project decisions, including decisions related to the joint venture's internal controls, which may not be subject to the same internal control procedures that we employ.  If these unaffiliated third parties do not fulfill their contract obligations, the partnerships or joint ventures may be unable to adequately perform and deliver their contracted services.  Under these circumstances, we may be obligated to pay financial penalties, provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services, and may be jointly and severally liable for the other's actions or contract performance.  These additional obligations could result in reduced profits and revenues or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture, which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve.. If our reports and opinions are not in compliance with professional standards and other regulations, we could be subject to monetary damages and penalties.. We issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise, as well as our other professional credentials. Our reports and opinions may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations, and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction in which the services are performed. In addition, we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports or opinions even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. For example, if we deliver an inaccurate report or one that is not in compliance with the relevant standards, and that report is made available to a third party, we could be subject to third - party liability, resulting in monetary damages and penalties.. We may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet milestone requirements in our contracts.. We may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet milestone requirements in our contracts.  Failure to meet any of the milestone requirements could result in additional costs, and the amount of such. 33. Table of Contents. additional costs could exceed the projected profits on the project.  These additional costs include liquidated damages paid under contractual penalty provisions, which can be substantial and can accrue on a regular basis.. Force majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man - made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate by causing the closure of offices, interrupting projects, and forcing the relocation of employees. We typically remain obligated to perform our services after a terrorist action or natural disaster unless the contract contains a force majeure clause that relieves us of our contractual obligations in such an extraordinary event. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. We rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property where we do not believe that patent or copyright protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In addition, we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In addition, if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks or other proprietary information, our competitive position could be adversely affected.. Employee, agent, or partner misconduct, or our failure to comply with anti-bribery and other laws or regulations, could harm our reputation, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.. Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents, or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation.  Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, environmental laws, and any other applicable laws or regulations.  Our policies mandate compliance with these regulations and laws, and we take precautions to prevent and detect misconduct.  However, since our internal controls are subject to inherent limitations, including human error, it is possible that these controls could be intentionally circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions.  As a result, we cannot assure that our controls will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.  Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearances, and suspension or debarment from contracting, any or all of which could harm our reputation, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.. 34. Table of Contents. Our failure to implement and comply with our safety program could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.. Our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management, and the implementation of the safety program is a significant issue in our dealings with our clients.  We maintain an enterprise-wide group of health and safety professionals to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes.  Unsafe job sites and office environments have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable, and raise our operating costs.  The implementation of our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus, and may be evaluated by certain clients in cases in which safety requirements have been established in our contracts.  Our failure to meet these requirements or our failure to properly implement and comply with our safety program could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We may be subject to liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.. Our services are subject to numerous U.S. and international environmental protection laws and regulations that are complex and stringent.  For example, we must comply with a number of U.S. federal government laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances.  Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\"), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials.  CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict, joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances.  The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party.  Other principal U.S. federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, but are not limited to, the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the \"Mine Act\"), the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act.  Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection.  Further, past business practices at companies that we have acquired may also expose us to future unknown environmental liabilities.  Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury or cessation of remediation activities.  Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability.. Our bylaws, our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.. Provisions of our bylaws, our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequiring at least a supermajority vote of the outstanding shares of our common stock for stockholders to amend our bylaws or certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;. 35. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablishing advance notice procedure for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors, or bring other business before an annual or special meeting of the stockholders; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorizing the Board of Directors to issue \"blank check\" preferred stock or authorized but unissued shares of common stock without stockholder approval.. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, subject to some exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any \"interested stockholder\" (which is generally defined as an entity or person who, together with the person's affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or within three years prior to the time of determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation), for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.. Systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate.. We rely heavily on computer, information, and communications technology and systems to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. If we are unable to effectively deploy software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take steps to improve and protect our systems, systems operations could be interrupted or delayed.. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, and similar events or disruptions. In addition, we face the threat of unauthorized system access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber - attacks, and other security breaches and system disruptions. We devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to threats. Anyone who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in system operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches, or to alleviate problems caused by disruptions and breaches.. Any of these or other events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data that could delay or prevent operations, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and could negatively impact our clients.. The diversity of the services we provide, and the clients we serve, may create actual, potential, and perceived conflicts of interest and conflicts of business that limit our growth and could lead to potential liabilities for us.. Because we provide services to a wide array of both government and commercial clients, occasions arise where, due to actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest or business conflicts, we cannot perform work for which we are qualified. A number of our contracts contain limitations on the work we can perform for others, such as, for example, when we are assisting a government agency or department in developing regulations or enforcement strategies. Actual, potential, and perceived conflicts limit the work we can do and, consequently, can limit our growth and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if we fail to address actual or potential conflicts properly, or even if we simply fail to recognize a perceived conflict, we may be in violation of our existing contracts, may otherwise incur liability, and may lose future business for not preventing the conflict from arising, and our reputation may suffer. Particularly as we grow our commercial business, we anticipate that conflicts of interest and business conflicts will pose a greater risk.. 36. Table of Contents. The price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past year and may continue to be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive.. The price of our common stock is volatile and may fluctuate significantly. For example, during our fiscal year ended December 29, 2017, the closing price of our stock ranged from a high of $36.54 per share to a low of $21.46 per share. We cannot assure you as to the prices at which our common stock will trade or that an active trading market in our common stock will be sustained in the future. In addition to the matters discussed in other risk factors included herein, some of the reasons for fluctuations in our stock price could include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance and prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level, or lack thereof, of research coverage of our common stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral financial, domestic, international, economic and other market conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe hiring or departure of key personnel; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay damages.. In addition, public stock markets have experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies, including our peer companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. We do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.. We currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under the credit agreement governing our credit facility and agreements governing any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Further, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under our existing or future indebtedness. Our credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.. If securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. Assuming we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our industry, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. 37.
