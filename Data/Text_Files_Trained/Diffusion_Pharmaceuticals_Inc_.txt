[1] "ITEM 1A. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRISK FACTORS. The following are significant factors known to us that could materially harm our business, operating results or financial condition or could cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statement made in this report:. Risks Related to Our Financial Needs. We have limited cash resources, have incurred significant losses since our inception and have a history of net losses and negative cash flow from operations.. We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company and, as a result, we have a limited operating history and there is little historical basis from which to assess how we will respond to competitive or economic challenges or other challenges to our business. Our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by similarly situated companies.. We have limited cash resources, have generated substantial net losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations for other product candidates. We expect to incur losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our product candidates, if approved, will depend on numerous factors described in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity.. We currently generate no revenue from the sale of products and may never become profitable.. To date, we have not generated any revenues from our product candidates. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for our product candidates, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from our current product candidates or future products also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplete and submit NDAs to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for the products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we have retained commercialization rights; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfind suitable distribution partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets.. In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the process described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.. 29. We will require additional capital to fund our operations which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to advance the clinical development of our product candidates and to commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval. At the current time, the bulk of our cash resources for clinical development is dedicated to the Phase 3 trial for TSC in inoperable GBM. While we believe we have adequate cash resources to continue operations through June 2019, we will need to raise additional funds in order to complete this trial. We do not expect to commence any clinical trials beyond the inoperable GBM trial unless we are able to raise additional capital or make alternative financing arrangements for any such trial.. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Conditions in the credit markets and the financial services industry may make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain, and may negatively impact our ability to complete financing transactions. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives. We also could be required to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials for our product candidates and any future product candidates we may in-license; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe clinical development plans we establish for these product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe number and characteristics of product candidates that we in-license and develop; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost and timing of completion of becoming a commercial organization.. 30. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, receivables or royalty financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt, receivables and royalty financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. Risks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization. Our business is dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which include products primarily for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic cancer, stroke and brain metastases.. Our portfolio of product candidates includes TSC, which is a novel small molecule that re-oxygenates hypoxic tissue, enhancing the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy without harmful side effects in Phase 3 clinical development for glioblastoma multiforme. In addition, TSC may have potential applications in pancreatic cancer, stroke and brain metastases. The success of our business, including our ability to finance our company and generate any revenue in the future, primarily will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. In the future, we may also become dependent on one or more other product candidates or any future product candidates that we may in-license, acquire or develop. There have been many failures in drugs that other companies have tried to develop to treat the indications the company is or may be pursuing, including glioblastoma multiforme, pancreatic cancer, stroke and brain metastases. There can be no assurance that the company will have success where others have failed.. 31. The clinical and commercial success of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttimely completion of our clinical trials, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhether we are required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional clinical trials beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of our product candidates or any future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of our proposed indications and primary endpoint assessments relating to the proposed indications of our product candidates by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities, the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or any future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced with our product candidates or future approved products, if any; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tachieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that our third-party contractors achieve and maintain, compliance with our contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates or any future product candidates or approved products, if any; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of third parties with whom we contract to manufacture clinical trial and commercial supplies of our product candidates or any future product candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta continued acceptable safety profile during clinical development and following approval of our product candidates or any future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates in the United States and internationally, if approved for marketing, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration with others; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance by physicians and patients of the benefits, safety and efficacy of our product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved, including relative to alternative and competing treatments; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour and our partners’ ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to our product candidates or any future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour and our partners’ ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or commercial-stage products that we believe can be successfully developed and commercialized.. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize our product candidates. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, we may never be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of our product candidates or any future product candidates to continue our business.. 32. Clinical drug development for our product candidates is very expensive, time-consuming and uncertain. Our clinical trials may fail to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.. Clinical drug development for our product candidates is very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of a product candidate, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate is both safe and effective for use in the target indication. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization. Our product candidates are in early stages of development. We expect that clinical trials for these product candidates will take several years, but may take significantly longer than expected to complete. In addition, we, any partner with which we may in the future collaborate, the FDA, an IRB or other regulatory authorities, including state and local agencies and counterpart agencies in foreign countries, may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate our clinical trials at any time, for various reasons, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiscovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials or the failure of our product candidates to meet specified endpoints; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tslower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials resulting from numerous factors, including the prevalence of other companies’ clinical trials for their product candidates for the same indication, or clinical trials for indications for which patients do not as commonly seek treatment; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in obtaining IRB approval for studies to be conducted at each site; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in manufacturing or obtaining, or inability to manufacture or obtain, sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or the product formulation or method of delivery; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in applicable laws, regulations and regulatory policies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective clinical research organizations (“CROs”), clinical trial sites and other third-party contractors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty regarding proper dosing; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of our CROs or other third-party contractors to comply with contractual and regulatory requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by us, our employees, our CROs or their employees or any partner with which we may collaborate or their employees to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials or the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug products; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinsufficient data to support regulatory approval; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; or \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data.. 33. We or any partner with which we may collaborate may suffer significant setbacks in our or their clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. In the event that we or our potential partners abandon or are delayed in the clinical development efforts related to our product candidates, we may not be able to execute on our business plan effectively and our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would be harmed.. For example, we recently opened for enrollment and dosed our first patient under the protocol permitted by the FDA with respect to our Phase 3 clinical study of TSC. Although enrollment and dosing has commenced, there can be no assurance that we will not in the future encounter difficulties and/or delays in enrolling patients, opening additional clinical sites or other aspects of the study. In addition, we do not anticipate receiving data from the Phase 3 clinical study for a number of years, which time period could be further delayed by any such difficulties. Any of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or prospects.. We may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for TSC or our other future product candidates for the indications of which we are seeking under applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates. The delay, limitation or denial of any regulatory approval would adversely impact commercialization, our potential to generate revenue, our business and our operating results.. We currently have no products approved for sale, and we may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of our current or future product candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, distribution, import, export, and reporting of safety and other post-market information related to our drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and in foreign countries, and such regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing from the FDA. We are also not permitted to market any of our current product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the applicable regulatory authorities of such countries.. To gain approval to market a new drug, such as TSC, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities must receive preclinical and clinical data that adequately demonstrate the safety, purity, potency, efficacy and compliant manufacturing of the product for the intended indication applied for in an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing. The development and approval of new drug products involves a long, expensive and uncertain process, and delay or failure can occur at any stage. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 clinical development, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, findings made while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we or our partners may conduct.. The FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have substantial discretion in the drug approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of product candidates for many reasons, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with the design or implementation of one or more clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not deem a product candidate safe and effective for its proposed indication, or may deem a product candidate’s safety or other perceived risks to outweigh its clinical or other benefits;. 34. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials sufficient to support approval, or the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body for approval; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials performed by us or third parties, or with the interpretation of any partner with which we may collaborate; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other applicable regulatory filing; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may identify deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling or specifications of our current or future product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may require clinical trials in pediatric patients in order to establish pharmacokinetics or safety for this more drug-sensitive population; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly additional post-approval clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve our current or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may not approve of the manufacturing processes, controls or facilities of third-party manufacturers or testing labs with which we contract; or \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body may change its approval policies or adopt new regulations in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for approval.. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. Our product candidates may not be approved by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies even if they meet specified endpoints in our clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agencies may ask us to conduct additional costly and time-consuming clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval or approval to enter into an advanced phase of development, or may change the requirements for approval even after such agency has reviewed and commented on the design for the clinical trials.. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval for any of our product candidates would delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates and would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. Even if our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.. The commercial success of any of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians and patients for approved indications, and may not be commercially successful. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of our current or future product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for approved products that treat those indications;. 35. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our product as compared to other available therapies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors for any of our product candidates that may be approved; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay for the product, if approved, on the part of patients; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tphysician and patient willingness to adopt a new therapy over other available therapies to treat approved indications; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tovercoming any biases physicians or patients may have toward particular therapies for the treatment of approved indications; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproper training and administration of our product candidates by physicians and medical staff; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpatient satisfaction with the results and administration of our product candidates and overall treatment experience; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe willingness of patients to pay for certain of our product candidates relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe revenue and profitability that our product candidate may offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prevalence and severity of side effects; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved labeling for our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany FDA requirement to undertake a REMS; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential product liability claims.. Our product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration.. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of health care products competitive with those that we are developing. We face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our expected target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts.. Many pharmaceutical companies currently offer products, and continue to develop additional alternative product candidates and technologies, for indications similar to those targeted by our product candidates. We anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies. If approved, our product candidates may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. Certain of our product candidates, if approved, will present novel therapeutic approaches for the approved indications and will have to compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our products, when and if approved, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidates and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. For more information about the competition we face, see “Business—Competition.”. 36. Due to less stringent regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available for use in those international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States.. Any product candidates that we commercialize, or that any partner with which we may collaborate commercializes, will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review.. Even after we or our partners achieve U.S. regulatory approval for a product candidate, if any, we or our partners will be subject to continued regulatory review and compliance obligations. For example, with respect to our product candidates, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. A product candidate’s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials or a REMS, to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. We will also be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to, among other things, the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our product candidates. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP requirements and with the FDA’s GCP requirements and good laboratory practice (“GLP”) requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development, and for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. To the extent that a product candidate is approved for sale in other countries, we may be subject to similar restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries.. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where, or processes by which, the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requesting that we initiate a product recall, or requiring notice to physicians, withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us or our partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;. 37. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcommence criminal investigations and prosecutions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpose injunctions, suspensions or revocations of necessary approvals or other licenses; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpose other civil or criminal penalties; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend any ongoing clinical trials; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our potential partners; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trefuse to permit drugs or precursor chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseize or detain products or require us or our partners to initiate a product recall.. The regulations, policies or guidance of the FDA and other applicable government agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates, which would adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.. We have conducted and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States and the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.. We have conducted and may in the future choose to conduct one or more of our clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States or the applicable jurisdiction, acceptance of such study data by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the data are considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar requirements. In addition, such foreign studies would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the studies are conducted. There can be no assurance the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan.. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or result in post-approval regulatory action.. Unforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the approved product has been marketed. Undesirable side effects caused by product candidates could cause us, any partners with which we may collaborate or regulatory authorities to interrupt, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us, or our potential partners, to cease further development of or deny approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. 38. Additionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by our product candidates after obtaining U.S. or foreign regulatory approval or other products with the same or related active ingredients, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require a recall of the product or we or our potential partners may voluntarily recall a product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings or contraindications in the product labeling, narrowing of the indication in the product label or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients or institute a REMS; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may have limitations on how we promote the product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may require additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsales of the product may decrease significantly; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour brand and reputation may suffer.. Any of the above events resulting from undesirable side effects or other previously unknown problems could prevent us or our potential partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.. Because the results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance into additional clinical trials may not continue to have favorable results or receive regulatory approval.. Success in preclinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after reporting promising results in earlier clinical trials. We do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety or otherwise provide adequate information to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be compromised.. 39. We may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.. We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority. Our products and product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product candidates could result in injury to a patient or even death. We cannot offer any assurance that we will not face product liability suits in the future, nor can we assure you that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover our liability under any such cases.. In addition, a liability claim may be brought against us even if our product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates, among others. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we will incur substantial liabilities and reputational harm. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twithdrawal of clinical trial participants; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreased demand for our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of our business reputation; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial costs of any related litigation or similar disputes; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdistraction of management’s attention and other resources from our primary business; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants against us that may not be covered by insurance; or \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tloss of revenue.. We have obtained product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials. However, large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects and our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. We will need to increase our product liability coverage if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, which will be costly, and we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. 40. If any of our product candidates are approved for marketing and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, product liability claims and significant fines, penalties and sanctions, and our brand and reputation could be harmed.. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about drug products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product’s approved labeling and comparative safety or efficacy claims cannot be made without direct comparative clinical data. If we are found to have promoted off-label uses of any of our product candidates, we may receive warning or untitled letters and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. Both federal and state governments have levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and have enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management’s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred and our brand and reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label use, we could be subject to FDA regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our business activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.. We cannot, however, prevent a physician from using our product candidates outside of those indications for use when in the physician’s independent professional medical judgment he or she deems appropriate. Physicians may also misuse our product candidates or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to product liability claims. If our product candidates are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by physicians or their patients. Furthermore, the use of our product candidates for indications other than those cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation among physicians and patients.. We may choose not to continue developing or commercializing any of our product candidates at any time during development or after approval, which would reduce or eliminate our potential return on investment for those product candidates.. At any time, we may decide to discontinue the development of any of our product candidates or not to continue commercializing one or more of our approved product candidates for a variety of reasons, including changes in our internal product, technology or indication focus, the appearance of new technologies that make our product obsolete, competition from a competing product or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we terminate a program in which we have invested significant resources, we will not receive any return on our investment and we will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses.. We or our prospective partners may be subject to product recalls in the future that could harm our brand and reputation and could negatively affect our business.. We or our prospective partners may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, fail to meet specifications or are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations including those related to the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution. Any recall, withdrawal or seizure in the future could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and lead to decreased demand for our approved products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our approved products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and would harm our business, financial condition and operating results.. 41. If we or any partners with which we may collaborate are unable to achieve and maintain coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval, or any future products we may seek to commercialize, their commercial success may be severely hindered.. For any of our product candidates that become available only by prescription, successful sales by us or by any partners with which we may collaborate depend on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. The availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private third-party payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. If any of our product candidates do not demonstrate attractive efficacy profiles, they may not qualify for coverage and reimbursement. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.. In addition, the market for our product candidates will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.. Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, although private third-party payors tend to follow Medicare, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.. Further, we believe that future coverage and reimbursement will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for any of our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and product candidates.. In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenue and profitability and the future revenue and profitability of any partner with which we may collaborate. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act. It contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which are expected to impact existing government healthcare programs and result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (2) established annual fees on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and (3) enacted a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.. 42. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers.. Further, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, signed into law in April 2014, provides for a 0.5% change from 2013 federal payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2014 and a 0% update from January 1 until April 1, 2015. Congressional failure to intervene to prevent these changes in payment rates may adversely affect our future revenue and operating results. The 21st Century Cures Act, which the U.S. House of Representatives passed in July 2015 and President Obama signed into law in December 2016, provides a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections from genetic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products.. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the Affordable Care Act in the future. The Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress have indicated that they may continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. More recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.. In addition, we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Trump administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. Notably, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, which requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted. We operate in a highly regulated industry such that the potential for legislative reform provides uncertainty and potential threats to our operating models and results.. The delivery of healthcare services and products is highly regulated in most of the countries in which we may operate. Proposals for legislative reform in these countries are often introduced to improve access to care, address quality of care issues and manage costs of the healthcare system. In the US, the Trump administration and the 115th Congress have publicly announced their intention to pursue, and may enact, significant changes to existing health care programs. Certain health insurance provisions of Affordable Care Act, if not many more Affordable Care Act provisions, are likely targets for change. Changes of this nature could have significant effects on our businesses, both positive and negative, but the outcomes are impossible to predict.. 43. We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.. Certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients’ rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we or our partners conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including, for example, the federal civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.. Additional health care reform legislation further strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.. 44. Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with which we may collaborate may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.. We are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with which we may collaborate may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these persons could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: laws or regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities; manufacturing standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations, and serious harm to our reputation. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our operating results.. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties. We expect to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee our clinical trials and other aspects of product development. If these third parties do not meet our requirements or otherwise conduct the trials as required, we may not be able to satisfy our contractual obligations or obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates when expected or at all.. We expect to rely on third-party CROs to conduct and oversee our clinical trials and other aspects of product development. We also rely upon various medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s regulations and GCPs, which are an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and state regulations governing the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug products. These CROs and other third parties play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials. We rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and control only certain aspects of their activities. We and our CROs and other third-party contractors are required to comply with GCP and GLP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP and GLP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP and GLP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other regulatory authority may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our or our partners’ marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical or preclinical trials complies with applicable GCP and GLP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must generally be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations and policies may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.. 45. If any of our CROs or clinical trial sites terminate their involvement in one of our clinical trials for any reason, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical trial sites, or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if our relationship with clinical trial sites is terminated, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and could receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned by the FDA.. We rely completely on third-party contractors to supply, manufacture and distribute clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, including certain sole-source suppliers and manufacturers, we intend to rely on third parties for commercial supply, manufacturing and distribution if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and we expect to rely on third parties for supply, manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates. We do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to supply, manufacture or distribute preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of drug substances or products.. Our ability to develop our product candidates depends and our ability to commercially supply our products will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) and other substances and materials used in our product candidates from third parties and to have finished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and commercialization. If we fail to develop and maintain supply relationships with these third parties, we may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize our product candidates.. We do not have direct control over the ability of our contract suppliers and manufacturers to maintain adequate capacity and capabilities to serve our needs, including quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements such as cGMPs, we are dependent on our contract suppliers and manufacturers for day-to-day compliance with cGMPs for production of both APIs and finished products. Facilities used by our contract suppliers and manufacturers to produce the APIs and other substances and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection and be approved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. Our contract suppliers and manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program and review of submitted technical information. If the safety of any product or product candidate or component is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for the affected product or product candidate, and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay or termination of preclinical studies, clinical trials or regulatory submissions or approvals of our product candidates, and could entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our approved products on a timely basis, or at all.. We also rely and will continue to rely on certain third parties as the sole source of the materials they supply or the finished products they manufacture. In the event an existing supplier fails to supply product on a timely basis or in the requested amount, supplies product that fails to meet regulatory requirements, becomes unavailable through business interruption or financial insolvency or loses its regulatory status as an approved source or if we or our manufacturers are unable to renew current supply agreements when such agreements expire and we do not have a second supplier, we likely would incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement manufacturers and materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. In certain cases we may be required to get regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers, and this process of approval could delay production of our products or development of product candidates indefinitely. We and our manufacturers do not currently maintain inventory of these APIs and other substances and materials. Any interruption in the supply of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\") or other substance or material or in the manufacture of a finished product could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. 46. In addition, these contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and manufacture materials or products for such companies, which also exposes our suppliers and manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may also affect the regulatory clearance of a contract supplier’s or manufacturer’s facility. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory agency does not approve these facilities for the supply or manufacture of our product candidates, or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative supply or manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of or market our product candidates, if approved.. To date, our drug substances and product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials. As we prepare for later-stage clinical trials and potential commercialization, we will need to take steps to increase the scale of production of our drug substances and product candidates, which may include transferring production to new third-party suppliers or manufacturers. In order to conduct larger or late-stage scale clinical trials for our product candidates and supply sufficient commercial quantities of the resulting drug product and its components, if that product candidate is approved for sale, our contract manufacturers and suppliers will need to produce our drug substances and product candidates in larger quantities, more cost effectively and, in certain cases, at higher yields than they currently achieve. These third-party contractors may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for any of such drug substance and product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. Significant scale up of manufacturing may require additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which are costly, may not be successful and which the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities must review and approve. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a product candidate itself or of a product candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the APIs or the finished product. If our third-party contractors are unable to successfully scale up the manufacture of any of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers or manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and we are unable to successfully transfer the processes on a timely basis, the development of that product candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting products may be delayed, or there may be a shortage in supply, either of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. We expect to continue to depend on third-party contract suppliers and manufacturers for the foreseeable future. Our supply and manufacturing agreements, if any, do not guarantee that a contract supplier or manufacturer will provide services adequate for our needs. We and our contract suppliers and manufacturers continue to improve production processes, certain aspects of which are complex and unique, and we may encounter difficulties with new or existing processes. While we attempt to build in certain contractual obligations on such third-party suppliers and manufacturers, we may not be able to ensure that such third parties comply with these obligations. Depending on the extent of any difficulties encountered, we could experience an interruption in clinical or commercial supply, with the result that the development, regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or interrupted. In addition, third-party suppliers and manufacturers may have the ability to increase the price payable by us for the supply of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates, in some cases without our consent.. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ facilities or equipment may significantly impair our ability to have our product candidates manufactured on a timely basis. Furthermore, if a contract manufacturer or supplier becomes financially distressed or insolvent, or discontinues our relationship beyond the term of any existing agreement for any other reason, this could result in substantial management time and expense to identify, qualify and transfer processes to alternative manufacturers or suppliers, and could lead to an interruption in clinical or commercial supply.. 47. Our reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers further exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may misappropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our products or product candidates or their components into the United States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency approval requirements or import inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging.. Because we currently rely on a sole supplier to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of certain of our product candidates, any production problems with our supplier could adversely affect us.. We have relied upon supply agreements with third parties for the manufacture and supply of the bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients used in certain of our product candidates for purposes of preclinical testing and clinical trials. We presently depend upon a single source as the sole manufacturer of our supply of APIs for certain of our product candidates. Although we have identified alternate sources for these supplies, it would be time-consuming and costly to qualify these sources. Since we currently obtain our API from this manufacturer on a purchase-order basis, either we or the supplier may terminate our arrangements, without cause, at any time without notice. If our supplier was to terminate our arrangement or fail to meet our supply needs we might be forced to delay our development.. Manufacturing and supply of the APIs and other substances and materials used in our product candidates and finished drug products is a complex and technically challenging undertaking, and there is potential for failure at many points in the manufacturing, testing, quality assurance and distribution supply chain, as well as the potential for latent defects after products have been manufactured and distributed.. Manufacturing and supply of APIs, other substances and materials and finished drug products is technically challenging. Changes beyond our direct control can impact the quality, volume, price and successful delivery of our product candidates and can impede, delay, limit or prevent the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Mistakes and mishandling are not uncommon and can affect successful production and supply. Some of these risks include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure of our manufacturers to follow cGMP requirements or mishandling of product while in production or in preparation for transit; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability of our contract suppliers and manufacturers to efficiently and cost-effectively increase and maintain high yields and batch quality, consistency and stability; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in establishing optimal drug delivery substances and techniques, production and storage methods and packaging and shipment processes; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransportation and import/export risk, particularly given the global nature of our supply chain; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in analytical results or failure of analytical techniques that we depend on for quality control and release of product; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters, labor disputes, financial distress, lack of raw material supply, issues with facilities and equipment or other forms of disruption to business operations of our contract manufacturers and suppliers; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlatent defects that may become apparent after product has been released and which may result in recall and destruction of product.. Any of these factors could result in delays or higher costs in connection with our clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our products, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. 48. If we are not able to establish and maintain collaborations, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.. The development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. In order to fund further development of our product candidates, we may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the partner’s resources and experience, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed partner’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials; the likelihood of approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; the potential market for the subject product candidate; the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients; the potential of competing products; any uncertainty with respect to our ownership of our intellectual property; and industry and market conditions generally. The partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available for collaboration and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. We may also be restricted under future license agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential partners. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future partners. Collaborations typically impose detailed obligations on each party. If we were to breach our obligations, we may face substantial consequences, including potential termination of the collaboration, and our rights to our partners’ product candidates, in which we have invested substantial time and money, would be lost.. We may not be successful in our efforts to implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our product candidates. When we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish to the third party some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may be unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development.. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.. Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Operations. We will need to further increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in executing our growth strategy and managing any growth.. Our management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place are not adequate to support our business plan and future growth. We will need to further expand our scientific, clinical, managerial, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development and commercialization activities, all of which will require additional capital resources.. 49. Our need to manage our operations, growth and various projects effectively requires that we:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontinue to improve our operational, clinical, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tattract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage our preclinical and clinical trials effectively; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage our third-party supply and manufacturing operations effectively and in a cost-effective manner, while increasing production capabilities for our current product candidates to commercial levels; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to partners and other third parties; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanage our commercialization activities for our product candidates effectively and in a cost-effective manner; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish and maintain relationships with development and commercialization partners.. In addition, historically, we have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants to perform a number of tasks for us, including tasks related to preclinical and clinical testing. Our growth strategy may also entail expanding our use of consultants to implement these and other tasks going forward. We rely on consultants for certain functions of our business and will need to effectively manage these consultants to ensure that they successfully carry out their contractual obligations and meet expected deadlines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside consultants, as needed, on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to effectively manage our growth and expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our use of consultants, we might be unable to implement successfully the tasks necessary to execute effectively on our planned research, development and commercialization activities and, accordingly, might not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.. If we fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to continue to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, clinical, scientific, medical, sales and marketing and other personnel. We are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Business Officer and our Senior Vice President – Finance, Treasurer and Secretary, certain consultants and members of our Board who are well known and respected in our industry. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could impede, delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials, commercialization of our product candidates or in-licensing or acquisition of new assets and could negatively impact our ability to successfully implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, we might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. We do not maintain “key man” insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Business Officer and our Senior Vice President – Finance, Treasurer and Secretary, each of whom is subject to an employment agreement, we employ our executive officers and key personnel on an at-will basis and their employment can be terminated by us or them at any time, for any reason and without notice. In order to retain valuable employees at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we provide stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract offers from other companies.. We might not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the Charlottesville, Virginia area where we are headquartered. We could have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives.. 50. We currently have no sales and marketing personnel or capabilities. If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties when we are ready to commercialize our product candidates, we will be unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.. We currently have no sales and marketing personnel or capabilities. To commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the United States, Canada, the European Union and other jurisdictions we may seek to enter, we must build our marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. We as a company have no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may choose to collaborate with additional third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. The inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. If we implement activities to in-license and acquire product candidates and we in-license and acquire commercial-stage products or engage in other strategic transactions, it could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.. If we implement a strategy to in-license and acquire product candidates, we may in-license and acquire commercial-stage products or engage in other strategic transactions. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions entail numerous potential operational and financial risks, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposure to unknown liabilities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisruption of our business and diversion of our management’s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial acquisition and integration costs; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twrite-downs of assets or impairment charges; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased amortization expenses;. 51. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpairment of relationships with key suppliers, partners or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to retain our key employees or those of any acquired businesses.. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, and any transaction that we do complete could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. We have no current plan, commitment or obligation to enter into any other transaction described above.. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations.. Our near-term operations will be limited primarily to researching and developing our product candidates and undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or approved products on the market. From time to time, we may enter into collaboration agreements and license agreements with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone expenditures and payments, and we expect that amounts earned from or paid pursuant to these agreements will be a significant source of our capital expenditures and an important source of our revenue. Accordingly, our revenue and profitability may depend on development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones under potential future collaboration and license agreements and sales of our products, if approved. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from period to period and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one period to the next. In addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award as determined by our Board, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price and estimated volatility, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly. Furthermore, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in the commencement, enrollment and the timing of clinical testing for our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and success or failure of clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on FDA guidelines and requirements, and the quantity of production; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of demand for our product candidates, should they receive approval, which may vary significantly; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential side effects of our product candidates that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;. 52. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of patients or healthcare providers to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to establish an effective sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure in a timely manner; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and our ability to forecast demand for those product candidates; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to receive approval and commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability and third parties’ abilities to protect intellectual property rights; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts related to and outcomes of potential litigation or other disputes; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to adequately support future growth; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to maintain adequate insurance policies; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.. If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur significant costs.. In connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and product candidates, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.. Our operating results and liquidity needs could be negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn.. Our operating results and liquidity could be negatively affected by economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Domestic and international equity and debt markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns. In the event these economic conditions and concerns continue or worsen and the markets continue to remain volatile, our operating results and liquidity could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways, including weakening demand for certain of our product candidates and making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary, and our stock price may decline. Additionally, although we plan to market our products primarily in the United States, our partners may have extensive global operations, indirectly exposing us to risk.. 53. Security breaches and other disruptions in our information technology systems could limit our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations, compromise our or third parties’ confidential information or otherwise adversely affect our operating results or business reputation.. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions, including processing, transmitting, storing, managing and supporting a variety of business processes, activities and information. Further, as we pursue our growth and business development strategy and pursue new initiatives that improve our operations, we are also expanding and improving our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Any disruption in any of these systems or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions.. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of third parties, in data centers and on information technology networks, including cloud-based networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Further, the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including mobile devices, has heightened the risk of unintentional data breaches or leaks. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems or to comply with privacy, data security, cybersecurity and data protection laws applicable to our business. Any failure to effectively prevent, detect and/or recover from any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, or to comply with any such current or future law related thereto, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may be limited.. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $41.2 million in NOL carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, if any, for income tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal and Virginia NOL carryforwards will begin expiring during the year ended December 31, 2034. Under Section 382 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that our reverse merger in January 2016, and other transactions that have occurred, triggered an “ownership change” limitation that significantly limited our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards. Our 2017 and 2018 financing transactions may have also triggered an ownership change, which could further limit our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards. We have yet to determine this potential limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of equity offerings and other shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, similar limitations may apply at the state level and there may be periods during which the use of NOL carryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.. We may be adversely affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.. Our corporate headquarters are located in Charlottesville, Virginia. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as enterprise financial systems, manufacturing resource planning or enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Our contract manufacturers’ and suppliers’ facilities are located in multiple locations, where other natural disasters or similar events, such as blizzards, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. In addition, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the businesses of our partners, manufacturers or the economy as a whole. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if we do not implement a disaster recovery plan or our partners’ or manufacturers’ disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays in the regulatory approval, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of our product candidates, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects would suffer.. 54. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. We may not be able to obtain or enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and technologies that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.. Our success with respect to our product candidates and technologies will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in both the United States and other countries, to preserve our trade secrets and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our ability to protect any of our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents.. Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we believe there is a market opportunity for our products. The covered technology and the scope of coverage vary from country to country. For those countries where we do not have granted patents, we may not have any ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our technologies. Any patents that we may obtain may be narrow in scope and thus easily circumvented by competitors. Further, in countries where we do not have granted patents, third parties may be able to make, use or sell products identical to or substantially similar to, our product candidates.. The patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors and licensees may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If our current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.. Due to legal standards relating to patentability, validity, enforceability and claim scope of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, rights under any existing patents or any patents we might obtain or license may not cover our product candidates, or may not provide us with sufficient protection for our product candidates to afford a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded and generic pharmaceutical companies. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if patents have issued or will issue, we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.. 55. Competitors in the fields of oncology have created a substantial amount of prior art, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Although we believe that our technology includes certain inventions that are unique and not duplicative of any prior art, we do not have outstanding issued patents covering all of the recent developments in our technology and we are unsure of the patent protection that we will be successful in obtaining, if any. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may design around or challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents we hold or pursue with respect to our product candidates is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, or threaten our ability to commercialize, our product candidates.. The laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, our business prospects could be substantially harmed. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.. The degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain. Patent protection may be unavailable or severely limited in some cases and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe might not have been the first to invent or the first to file the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany patents we obtain or our licensors’ issued patents may not encompass commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany patents we obtain or our in-licensed issued patents may not be valid or enforceable; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of our product candidates. Further, the extensive period of time between patent filing and regulatory approval for a product candidate limits the time during which we can market a product candidate under patent protection, which may particularly affect the profitability of our early-stage product candidates.. Proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and intellectual property protection agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our suppliers, manufacturers and other third parties. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secret information.. 56. Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.. The United States has enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the scope and value of patents, once obtained.. For our U.S. patent applications containing a priority claim after March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, also known as the America Invents Act (“AIA”) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a “first-to-file” system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.. Among some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors’ ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.. 57. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if our patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to our patents to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. Finally, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in foreign intellectual property laws.. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.. Periodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on our business.. If we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that marketing and selling such candidates and using such technologies will not infringe existing or future patents. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields relating to our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that our product candidates, technologies or methods of delivery or use infringe their patent rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various drugs, biologics, drug delivery systems or their methods of use, and which of these patents may be valid and enforceable. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our fields, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates, technologies or methods.. 58. In addition, there may be issued patents of third parties that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by our product candidates or proprietary technologies. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen (18) months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our own and in-licensed issued patents or our pending applications. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our product candidates or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our own and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, we or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate, in the United States, in an interference proceeding to determine priority of invention.. We may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe such third parties’ intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drug and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect our operating results and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel, even if we do not infringe such patents or the patents asserted against us are ultimately established as invalid. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party’s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party’s patents.. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries generally. To date, no litigation asserting infringement claims has been brought against us. If a third party claims that we infringe its intellectual property rights, we may face a number of issues, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinfringement and other intellectual property claims which, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and may divert our management’s attention from our core business; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubstantial damages for infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or technology at issue infringes or violates the third party’s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay treble damages and the patent owner’s attorneys’ fees; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product or using the technology unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us, which it is not required to do; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or upfront fees or grant cross-licenses to intellectual property rights for our products or technologies; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tredesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could harm our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. Because we may in the future rely on certain third-party licensors and partners, if one of those licensors or partners is sued for infringing a third party’s intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could suffer in the same manner as if we were sued directly. In addition to facing litigation risks, we may agree in the future to indemnify certain third-party licensors and partners against claims of infringement caused by our proprietary technologies, and we may enter into cost-sharing agreements with some our licensors and partners that could require us to pay some of the costs of patent litigation brought against those third parties whether or not the alleged infringement is caused by our proprietary technologies. In certain instances, these cost-sharing agreements could also require us to assume greater responsibility for infringement damages than would be assumed just on the basis of our technology.. 59. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property which could be expensive and time-consuming.. Competitors may infringe our intellectual property, including our patents. As a result, we may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied. An adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, interpreted narrowly or amended such that they do not cover our product candidates. Moreover, such adverse determinations could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, or issuing with limited and potentially inadequate scope to cover our product candidates or to prevent others from marketing similar products.. Interference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our licensors or potential partners. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign patent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management. We may not be able, alone or with our licensors or potential partners, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or other proceedings. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for Common Stock could be significantly harmed.. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or their former or current customers.. As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, certain of our employees were formerly employed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Moreover, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees and consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Although we have no knowledge of any such claims being alleged to date, if such claims were to arise, litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, any such litigation could be protracted, expensive, a distraction to our management team, not viewed favorably by investors and other third parties and may potentially result in an unfavorable outcome.. 60. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Other Securities. If we cannot continue to satisfy the NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing standards and other NASDAQ rules, our Common Stock could be delisted, which would harm our business, the trading price of our Common Stock, our ability to raise additional capital and the liquidity of the market for our Common Stock.. Our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, either: (i) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $1 million and stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million; or (ii) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $1 million and a total market value of listed securities of at least $35 million.. There is no assurance that we will continue to meet the minimum closing price requirement and other listing requirements. For example, on March 2, 2018, we received a written notice from the staff (the “Staff”) of the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ indicating we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) because the bid price for our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days from the date of such notice, or until August 29, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the bid price for our common stock must close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days.. In the event that our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.. The trading volume of our Common Stock has historically been low and extremely volatile, which may result in decreased periods of liquidity or large, short-term fluctuations in our stock price.. The number of shares of our Common Stock being traded on a daily basis has historically been low and extremely volatile. Since January 8, 2016, the date we completed the Merger, through March 13, 2018, the daily trading volume for our Common Stock ranged from zero shares to 14,032,030 shares (after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split). The quotation of our Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists.. Any holder of our Common Stock wishing to sell his, her or its shares may cause a significant fluctuation in the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. We may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation in our Common Stock. Such volatility may be the result of broad market and industry factors. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for Common Stock may be highly volatile for factors specific to our own operations, many of which are beyond our control, including those described elsewhere in and incorporated into this Memorandum and our public filings.. Future sales of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may depress our stock price.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of Common Stock. If a large number of shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into Common Stock are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of Common Stock and impede our ability to raise future capital. In connection with the equity financing from January 2018, all of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock converted to shares of Common Stock, and make-whole and accrued dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock were paid in shares of Common Stock, with an aggregate of [X] shares of Common Stock being issued. All of such shares are covered by effective registration statements, pursuant to which the holders can sell such shares into the public market. In addition, in connection with the same financing, the Company issued warrants to purchase [Y] shares of Common Stock, which when added to the other warrants outstanding to purchase shares of Common Stock, total [Z] shares, which upon the exercise thereof, could result in an additional aggregate of [AA] shares of Common Stock being sold into the public market.. 61. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of Common Stock.. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of Common Stock. In addition, any future testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“SOX”), or any required subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement.. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of SOX, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. However, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President - Finance our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management’s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.. Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.. We incur significant costs as a result of our public company status and devote substantial management time to operating as a public company.. As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of SOX and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices and required filing of annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel devote significant time and attention to these public company requirements, which diverts their time attention from operational and other business matters.. 62. Delaware law and provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of Common Stock.. The anti-takeover provisions under Delaware corporate law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with stockholders owning in excess of 15 percent (15%) of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that only our Board will have the right to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that only our Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or a majority of our Board will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of Common Stock;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that our Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing so as to cause us to take certain corporate actions our stockholders may desire to take.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for common stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. Future sales of substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or other issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.. We need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our operations, fund additional clinical trials of our product candidates and potentially commercialize our product candidates. We plan to continue to finance our operations with a combination of equity issuances, debt arrangements and a possible partnership or license of development and/or commercialization rights to our product candidates. Any issuance of convertible debt securities, preferred stock or common stock may be at a discount from the then current trading price of our common stock. If we issue additional common or preferred stock or securities convertible into common stock, our stockholders will experience additional dilution, which may be significant.. In addition, pursuant to our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers, including officers, employees and service providers of our subsidiaries and affiliates. As of March 13, 2018, the number of shares of our common stock we have reserved for issuance under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan is 185,076 and future option grants and issuances of common stock under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will dilute the percentage ownership of our investors and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. 63. Further, future sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital. The exercise of our outstanding warrants into common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of common stock.. Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders exert significant influence over us and could impede a change of corporate control.. As of March 13, 2018, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than five percent of common stock, together with their affiliates, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 5.5% of our outstanding common stock (See “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management”). As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to exert significant influence on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to significantly influence the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could harm the market price of common stock by:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiscouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.. Delaware law and provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of Common Stock.. The anti-takeover provisions under Delaware corporate law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with stockholders owning in excess of 15 percent of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that only our Board will have the right to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our Board; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that only our Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or a majority of our Board will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that our Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\testablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcertain priorities, voting rights and other rights of the holders of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 64. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing so as to cause us to take certain corporate actions our stockholders may desire to take.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.. The trading market for Common Stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price for Common Stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for Common Stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.. We may be at an increased risk of securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.. The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.. We have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.. We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.. 65"
