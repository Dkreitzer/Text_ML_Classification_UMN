[1] "Item 1A.     Risk Factors:. An investment in our common stock involves numerous types of risks.  You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the disclosures under \"Forward-looking Information\" above in evaluating our Company and any potential investment in our common stock.  If any of the following risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock.  The risks and uncertainties described in this section are not the only ones facing us.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition.. Risks Relating To Our Business:. If we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and customer demands in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could materially suffer.. Customer tastes and fashion trends, particularly for women's apparel, are volatile, tend to change rapidly and cannot be predicted with certainty.  Our success depends in part upon our ability to consistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner.  Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify, design and respond to changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our merchandise, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and our image with our customers.  If we miscalculate either the market for our merchandise or our customers' tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which would adversely affect our margins and results of operations.. Fluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may negatively impact our gross margin and our overall results of operations.. Comparable sales are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Factors affecting comparable sales include fashion trends, customer preferences, calendar and holiday shifts, competition, weather and economic conditions. In addition, merchandise must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and before trends are confirmed by sales. If we are not able to accurately predict customers' preferences for our fashion items, we may have too much inventory which may cause excessive markdowns. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our merchandise, we may end up with inventory shortages resulting in missed sales. A decrease in comparable sales or our inability to effectively manage inventory may adversely affect our gross margin and results of operations.. 9. Existing and increased competition in the women's retail apparel industry may negatively impact our business,              results of operations, financial condition and market share.. The women's retail apparel industry is highly competitive.  We compete primarily with discount stores, mass merchandisers, department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores and internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have.  Many of our competitors offer frequent promotions and reduce their selling prices.  In some cases our competitors are expanding into markets in which we have a significant market presence.  In addition, our competitors also compete for the same retail store space. As a result of this competition, we may experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures, increased costs to open new stores, as well as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Because we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly and indirectly from overseas, we are subject to risks associated with international operations; changes, disruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting the Company's merchandise supply chain could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. A significant amount of our merchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in East Asia. We directly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import the remaining merchandise from domestic vendors who acquire the merchandise from foreign sources.  As a result, political, financial or other forms of instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from countries affecting our supply chain, increased security requirements for imported merchandise, or the imposition of additional regulations or changes in duties, quotas, tariffs, taxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other factors affecting the availability or cost of imports, could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. Our costs are also affected by currency fluctuations, and changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, increased energy and transportation costs have caused us significant cost increases from time to time, and future adverse changes in these costs or the disruption of the means by which merchandise is transported to us could cause additional cost increases or interruptions of our supply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions impacting any port or trade route through which our products move. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries or other domestic vendors with foreign sources in different countries, those goods may be more expensive or of a different or inferior quality from the ones we now sell.. Our ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent on the success of our store location strategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.. Our sales are dependent in part on the location of our stores in shopping centers where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop.  In addition, our ability to grow our revenues has been substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.  Centers where we currently operate existing stores or seek to open new stores may be adversely affected by, among other things, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the commercial real estate industry, the closing of anchor stores, changes in tenant mix and changes in customer shopping preferences.  To take advantage of consumer traffic and the shopping preferences of our consumers, we need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition for suitable store locations is intense. A decline in customer popularity of the strip shopping centers where we generally locate our stores or in availability of space in desirable centers and locations, or an increase in the cost of such desired space, limiting our ability to open new stores, could adversely affect consumer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.. 10. Our ability to open and operate new stores depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental permits and approvals and hire and train appropriate store personnel.  In addition, our continued expansion into new regions of the country where we have not done business before may present new challenges in competition, distribution and merchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely execute our plans for opening new stores or the failure of these stores to perform up to our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. The inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on time and to the Company's specification may adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our dependence on third-party vendors to manufacture and supply our merchandise subjects us to numerous risks that our vendors will fail to perform as we expect.  For example, the deterioration in any of our key vendors' financial condition, their failure to ship merchandise in a timely manner that meets our specifications, or other failures to follow our vendor guidelines or comply with applicable laws and regulations, including compliant labor, environmental practices and product safety, could expose us to operational, quality, competitive, reputational and legal risks.  If we are not able to timely or adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our vendors fail to perform as we expect, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Activities conducted by us or on our behalf outside the United States further subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed below under \"Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management's attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\". The operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may present increased legal and operational risks.. In October 2014, we established our own sourcing offices in Asia. Our experience with legal and regulatory practices and requirements in Asia is limited. If our sourcing offices are unable to successfully oversee merchandise production to ensure that product is produced on time and within the Company's specifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, the activities conducted by our sourcing office outside the United States further subject us to foreign operational risks, as well as U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section, in particular below under \"Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management's attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\". Any actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive consumer confidence and spending may materially and adversely affect consumer demand for our apparel and accessories and our results of operations.. Consumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions and uncertainties, political conditions and uncertainties (such as those currently being debated in the U.S. regarding budgetary, spending and tax policies), levels of employment, fuel, energy and food costs, salaries and wage rates and other sources of income, tax rates, home values, consumer net worth, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence and consumer perceptions of adverse changes in or trends affecting any of these conditions. Any perception that these conditions may be worsening or continuing to trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse perceptions of these conditions or uncertainties regarding them also generally cause consumers to defer purchases of discretionary items, such as our merchandise, or to purchase cheaper alternatives to our merchandise, all of which may also adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.  In addition, numerous events, whether or not related to actual economic conditions, such as downturns in the stock markets, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or natural disasters, or similar events, may also dampen consumer confidence, and accordingly, lead to reduced consumer spending.  Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. 11. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of inventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the Company may not be able to pass on to its customers.. Vendors are increasingly passing on higher production costs, which may impact our ability to maintain or grow our margins. The price and availability of raw materials may be impacted by demand, regulation, weather and crop yields, as well as other factors.  Additionally, manufacturers have and may continue to have increases in other manufacturing costs, such as transportation, labor and benefit costs. These increases in production costs result in higher merchandise costs to the Company. Due to the Company's limited flexibility in price point, the Company may not be able to pass on those cost increases to the consumer, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.. We rely on our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations, including merchandise planning, replenishment, pricing, ordering, markdowns and product life cycle management.  In addition to merchandise operations, we utilize our information technology systems for our distribution processes, as well as our financial systems, including accounts payable, general ledger, accounts receivable, sales, banking, inventory and fixed assets.  Despite the precautions we take, our information systems may be vulnerable to disruption or failure from numerous events, including but not limited to, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, similar catastrophic events or other causes beyond our control or that we fail to anticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to continue to upgrade or improve such systems, or the cost associated with maintaining, repairing or improving these systems, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current information technology systems may also disrupt our operations.. A disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or transportation network could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.. The distribution of our products is centralized in one distribution center in Charlotte, North Carolina and distributed through our network of third-party freight carriers.  The merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution center, where it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores and subsequently delivered to the stores by our third-party freight carriers.  If the distribution center or our third-party freight carriers were to be shut down or lose significant capacity for any reason, including but not limited to, any of the causes described under \"A failure or disruption relating to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business,\" our operations would likely be seriously disrupted.  Such problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to use our distribution center, as well as any broader problem generally affecting the ability to ship goods into our distribution center or deliver goods to our stores.  As a result, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the distribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Changes to accounting rules and regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and   financial condition.. 12. In an effort to provide greater comparability of financial reporting in an increasing global environment, accounting regulatory authorities have been in discussions for many years regarding efforts to either converge U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), have U.S. companies provide supplemental IFRS-based information or continue to work toward a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. If implemented, these potential changes in accounting rules or regulations could significantly impact our future reported results of operations and financial position.  Changes in accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules and regulations have significantly affected our reported financial statements and those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may continue to do so in the future.. For example, pending changes to lease accounting standards will require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements. These changes will have a major impact on the Company as a retailer with numerous leased locations. Such changes will require us to record a significant amount of lease-related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and make other changes to the recording and classification of lease-related expenses on our statements of income and cash flows. These changes could lead to the perception by investors that we are highly leveraged and would change the calculation of numerous financial metrics and measures of our performance and financial condition. These and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position.. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into its existing business, the Company's financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.. The Company's long-term business strategy includes growth through the development of new store concepts. This growth may require significant capital expenditures and management attention. The Company may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of a new business and integration costs may exceed anticipated amounts. We have incurred substantial financial commitments and fixed costs related to our retail stores that we will not be able to recover if our stores are not successful and that could potentially result in impairment charges. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.. A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operation, and efforts to mitigate these risks may continue to increase our costs.. The protection of employee, Company and customer data is critical to the Company. Any security breach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information, including but not limited to credit card data or other personally identifiable information, could severely damage the Company's reputation, expose it to remediation and other costs and the risks of legal proceedings, disrupt its operations and otherwise adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. Despite measures the Company takes to protect confidential information, which are ongoing and may continue to increase our costs, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent the compromise of such information. If any such compromise or unauthorized disclosure of this information were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.. We are subject to payment-related risks.. We accept payments using a variety of methods, including third-party credit cards, our own branded credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and physical bank checks. For existing and future payment methods we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and reduce the ease of use of certain payment methods), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time, raising our operating costs and lowering profitability. We rely on third-party service providers for payment processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these third-party service providers become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card-issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees. In addition we may lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers and process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.. 13. The Company's failure to successfully operate its e-commerce website or fulfill customer expectations could adversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and our business.. Although the Company's e-commerce platform provides another channel to drive incremental sales, provide existing customers the on-line shopping experience and introduce the Company to a new customer base, it also exposes us to numerous risks. We are subject to potential failures in the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our website, customer contact center or our distribution center, including system failures caused by telecommunication system providers, order volumes that exceed our present system capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems and human error.  Our e-commerce platform may also expose us to greater potential for security or data breaches involving the unauthorized disclosure of customer information, as discussed above under \"A security breach that results in unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could adversely affect our costs, reputation and results of operations.\" We are also subject to risk related to delays or failures in the performance of third parties, such as shipping companies, including delays associated with labor strikes or slowdowns or adverse weather conditions. If the Company does not successfully meet the challenges of operating an e-commerce website or fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be adversely affected.. Adverse litigation matters may adversely affect our business and our financial condition.. From time to time the Company is involved in litigation and other claims against our business. Primarily these arise from our normal course of business but are subject to risks and uncertainties, and could require significant management time. The Company's periodic evaluation of litigation-related matters may change our assessment in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us or by determination of judges, juries or other finders of fact. We may also be subjected to legal matters not yet known to us. Adverse decisions or settlements of disputes may negatively impact our business and our financial condition.. Failure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.. Like most retailers, we experience significant associate turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers.  Because our continued store growth will require the hiring and training of new associates, we must continually attract, hire and train new store associates to meet our staffing needs. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs, as well as possibly cause a decrease in our store operating efficiency and productivity.  We compete for qualified store associates, as well as experienced management personnel, with other companies in our industry or other industries, many of whom have greater financial resources than we do.. 14. In addition, we depend on key management personnel to oversee the operational divisions of the Company for the support of our existing business and future expansion. The success of executing our business strategy depends in large part on retaining key management. We compete for key management personnel with other retailers, and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could limit our ability to continue to grow.. If we are unable to retain our key management and store associates or attract, train, or retain other skilled personnel in the future, we may not be able to service our customers effectively or execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.. Our business operations subject us to legal compliance and litigation risks, as well as regulations and regulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased costs or liabilities, divert our management's attention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, as well as U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to our activities in foreign countries from which we source our merchandise and operate our sourcing offices.  Our business is also subject to regulatory and litigation risk in all of these jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions that may lack well-established or reliable legal systems for resolving legal disputes. Compliance risks and litigation claims have arisen and may continue to arise in the ordinary course of our business and include, among other issues, intellectual property issues, employment issues, commercial disputes, product-oriented matters, tax, customer relations and personal injury claims. International activities subject us to numerous U.S. and international regulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and export license requirements, privacy and data protection laws, environmental laws, records and information management regulations, tariffs and taxes and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, violations of which by employees or persons acting on the Company's behalf may result in significant investigation costs and severe criminal or civil sanctions.  These and other liabilities to which we may be subject could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and could divert significant management time.  The Company may also be subject to regulatory review and audits, which results may have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governing laws, rules and regulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change from time to time.  Compliance and litigation matters could result in unexpected expenses and liability, as well as have an adverse effect on our operations and our reputation.. If we fail to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or infringe the intellectual property rights of others, our business, brand image, growth strategy, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. We believe that our \"Cato\", \"It's Fashion\", \"It's Fashion Metro\" and \"Versona\" trademarks are integral to our store designs, brand recognition and our ability to successfully build consumer loyalty. Although we have registered these trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") and have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are important to our business, we cannot assure that these registrations will prevent imitation of our trademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Infringement of our names, concepts, store designs or merchandise generally, or particularly in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our image could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 15. In addition, we cannot assure that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights. In the event of such a conflict, we could be subject to lawsuits or other actions, the ultimate resolution of which we cannot predict; however, such a controversy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may experience market conditions that could adversely impact the valuation and liquidity of, and our ability to access, our short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.. Our short-term investments and cash equivalents are primarily comprised of investments in federal, state, municipal and corporate debt securities.  The value of those securities may be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as changes to credit ratings, rates of default, collateral value, discount rates, and strength and quality of market credit and liquidity.  As federal, state and municipal entities struggle with declining tax revenues and budget deficits, we cannot be assured of our ability to timely access these investments if the market for these issues declines.  Similarly, the default by issuers could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions that are in excess of the federally insured limits.  An economic downturn or development of adverse conditions affecting the financial sector and stability of financial institutions could cause us to experience losses on our deposits.. Maintaining and improving our internal control over financial reporting and other requirements necessary to operate as a public company may strain our resources, and any material failure in these controls may negatively impact our business, the price of our common stock and market confidence in our reported financial information.. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange and certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") and related rule-making that has been and may continue to be implemented over the next several years under the mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations have, and may continue to, increase our compliance costs and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. To satisfy the SEC's rules implementing the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must continue to document, test, monitor and enhance our internal control over financial reporting, which is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be re-evaluated frequently. We cannot give assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by applicable SEC rules, will be adequate in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or to comply with the other various laws and regulations to which we are and will continue to be subject, or to which we may become subject in the future, as a public company could have an adverse material impact on our business, our financial condition and the price of our common stock. In addition, our efforts to comply with these requirements, particularly with new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act that have yet to be implemented, could significantly increase our compliance costs.. Unusual weather, natural disasters or similar events may adversely affect our sales or operations.. Extreme changes in weather, natural disasters or similar events can influence customer trends and shopping habits.  For example, heavy rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability.  Our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.  Reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions would adversely affect our business.  The occurrence or threat of extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, outbreaks of flu or other communicable diseases or other catastrophic events could reduce customer traffic in our stores and likewise disrupt our ability to conduct operations, which could materially and adversely affect us.. 16. Risks Relating To The Market Value Of Our Common Stock:. Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the             market price of our common stock.. Our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail apparel industry.  As a result, our stores typically generate a higher percentage of our annual net sales and profitability in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year compared to other quarters.  Accordingly, our operating results for any one fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected from any future period, and such seasonal and quarterly fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. The interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of other shareholders to influence the direction of the Company.. As of March 27, 2018, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially controlled approximately 44.5% of the voting power of our common stock.  As a result, Mr. Cato may be able to control or significantly influence substantially all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other business combinations or other significant Company transactions. Mr. Cato may have interests that differ from those of other shareholders, and may vote in a way with which other shareholders disagree or perceive as adverse to their interests.  In addition, the concentration of voting power held by Mr. Cato could have the effect of preventing, discouraging or deferring a change in control of the Company, which could depress the market price of our common stock.. Conditions in the stock market generally, or particularly relating to our industry, Company or common stock, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make its trading price more volatile.. The trading price of our common stock at times has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significant volatility.  A variety of factors may cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, but not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report, as well as the following: low trading volume; general market fluctuations resulting from factors not directly related to our operations or the inherent value of our common stock; announcements of developments related to our business; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the fashion and retail industry; conditions or trends affecting or perceived to affect the domestic or global economy or the domestic or global credit or capital markets; changes in financial estimates or the scope of coverage given to our Company by securities analysts; negative commentary regarding our Company and corresponding short-selling market behavior; adverse customer relations developments; significant changes in our senior management team; and legal proceedings.  Over the past several years the stock market in general, and the market for shares of equity securities of many retailers in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies.  Such fluctuations and market volatility based on these or other factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock."
