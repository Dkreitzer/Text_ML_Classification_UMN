[1] "Item 1A.Risk Factors. Risks related to our business. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors.. Our business depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in offshore areas worldwide.  Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices.  Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide demand for oil and gas, including economic activity in the U.S. and other large energy - consuming markets;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") to set and maintain production levels, productive spare capacity and pricing;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of production in non - OPEC countries;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinternational sanctions on oil - producing countries, or the lifting of such sanctions;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvances in exploration, development and production technology;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe further development of shale technology to exploit oil and gas reserves;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlaws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\taccidents, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other similar incidents relating to the oil and gas industry; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe worldwide security and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities, civil unrest or other crises in the Middle East or other geographic areas or acts of terrorism.. Demand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies.  Prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity.  Perceptions of longer - term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long - term nature of many large - scale development projects.  Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.  Oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity.  However, increases in near - term commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased offshore drilling activity since customers' expectations of longer - term future commodity prices typically drive demand for our rigs.  Consistent with this dynamic, customers may delay or cancel many exploration and development programs, resulting in reduced demand for our services.  Also, increased competition for customers' drilling budgets could come from, among other areas, land - based energy markets worldwide.  The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers' drilling campaigns.  Worldwide military, political and economic events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.. The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which has a dominant market share.  Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis.  Although rig availability, service quality and technical capability are drivers of customer contract awards, bid pricing and intense price competition are often key determinants for which a qualified contractor is awarded a job.. The offshore drilling industry has historically been cyclical and is impacted by oil and natural gas price levels and volatility.  There have been periods of high customer demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of low customer demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates.  Changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply may intensify competition in the industry and result in the idling of older and less technologically advanced equipment.  We have idled and stacked rigs, and may in the future idle or stack additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate drilling contracts in response to market conditions.  Idled or stacked rigs may remain out of service for extended periods of time.. During prior periods of high dayrates and rig utilization rates, we and other industry participants have responded to increased customer demand by increasing the supply of rigs through ordering the construction of new units.  In periods of low oil and natural gas price levels, new construction has historically resulted in an oversupply of rigs and has caused a subsequent decline in dayrates and rig utilization rates, sometimes for extended periods of time.  Additional rigs that remain under construction, and the entry into service of these new units will increase overall supply.. Our two ultra - deepwater drillships currently under construction have not been contracted for work.  Combined with the expected increase in the number of rigs in the global market completing contracts and becoming idle, the number of new units expected to be delivered without contracts has intensified and may further intensify price competition.  Any further near - term increase in the construction. -  10  -. Table of Contents. of new units would likely exacerbate the negative impact of increased supply on dayrates and utilization rates.  Additionally, lower market dayrates and intense price competition may drive customers to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to lower dayrates in exchange for longer contract terms.  In an oversupplied market, we may have limited bargaining power to negotiate on more favorable terms.  Lower dayrates and rig utilization rates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events, and, during depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to repudiate or renegotiate their contracts.. Certain of our drilling contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment.  Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract.  Drilling contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non - performance, as a result of significant downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events.  Many of these events are beyond our control.  During periods of depressed market conditions, we are subject to an increased risk of our customers seeking to repudiate their contracts, including through claims of non - performance.  We are at continued risk of experiencing early contract terminations in the current weak commodity price environment as operators look to reduce their capital expenditures.  In February 2018, after experiencing equipment breakdown that could not be repaired timely, we and our customer mutually agreed to amend the drilling contract for one of our rigs at a reduced dayrate and for reduced duration.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our customers early terminated or cancelled contracts for one and eight of our rigs, respectively.  Our customers' ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts, including their ability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us, may also be negatively impacted by an economic downturn.  Our customers, which include national oil companies, often have significant bargaining leverage over us.  If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  See \"Item 1. Business - Contract Drilling Services.\". § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized.. At February 19, 2018, our contract backlog was approximately $12.8 billion.  This amount represents the number of days remaining in the firm term of the drilling contract multiplied by the maximum contractual operating dayrate, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation or other incentive provisions, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling revenues.  The contractual operating dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an alternative contractual dayrate, such as waiting on weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances.  Our contractual backlog includes amounts associated with our newbuild units that are currently under construction.  The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive because of a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations.  Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, including: equipment breakdowns and other unforeseen engineering problems, labor strikes and other work stoppages, shortages of material and skilled labor, surveys by government and maritime authorities, periodic classification surveys, severe weather or harsh operating conditions, and force majeure events.. In certain drilling contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time.  Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts or, in some cases, other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution.  We may not be able to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control.  In addition, some of our customers have experienced liquidity issues in the past and these liquidity issues could be experienced again if commodity prices decline for an extended period of time.  Liquidity issues and other market pressures could lead our customers to seek bankruptcy protection or to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate these agreements for various reasons (see \" - Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events, and, during depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to repudiate or renegotiate their contracts.\")  Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may not be able to renew or obtain new drilling contracts for rigs whose contracts are expiring, cancelled or terminated or obtain drilling contracts for our uncontracted newbuilds.. The offshore drilling markets in which we compete experience fluctuations in the demand for drilling services.  Our ability to renew expiring drilling contracts or obtain new drilling contracts depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions at the time of expiration.  A number of existing drilling contracts for our drilling rigs that are currently operating are scheduled to expire before December 31, 2018, and our two ultra - deepwater drillships currently under construction do not have customer drilling contracts.  We may be unable to obtain drilling contracts for our rigs that are currently operating upon the expiration or termination of such contracts or obtain drilling contracts for our newbuilds, and there may be a gap in the operation of the rigs between the current contracts and subsequent contracts.  When oil and natural gas prices are low or it is expected that such prices will decrease in the future, we may be unable to obtain drilling contracts at attractive dayrates or at all.  We may not be able to obtain new drilling contracts in direct continuation with existing contracts or for our uncontracted newbuild units, or depending on prevailing market conditions, we may enter into drilling contracts at dayrates substantially below the existing dayrates or on terms otherwise less favorable compared to existing contract terms, which may have an adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. -  11  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain our fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness and to comply with laws and the applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations, or to execute our growth plan.. We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain our fleet.  These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in the cost of labor and materials, requirements of customers, the size of our fleet, the cost of replacement parts for existing rigs, the geographic location of the rigs and the length of drilling contracts.  Our expenditures may also increase as a result of industry standards, governmental regulations and maritime self - regulatory organization and technical standards related to safety, security or the environment.. Changes in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness.  Changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures.  As a result, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment.  In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.. In addition, if we are unable to fund capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations or proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities.  Our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time, by changes in laws and regulations or interpretation thereof and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control.  If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, existing shareholders may experience dilution.  Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated statements of financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVarious credit rating agencies have rated our debt below investment grade, which could limit our access to capital and have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Three credit rating agencies have rated our non - credit enhanced senior unsecured long - term debt (\"Debt Rating\") below investment grade.  Our Debt Rating levels could have material adverse consequences on our business and future prospects and could:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to access debt markets, including for the purpose of refinancing our existing debt or replacing our existing credit agreements;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcause us to refinance, issue debt or enter into bank credit agreements with less favorable terms and conditions, which debt may require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease certain fees under our credit facilities and interest rates under indentures governing certain of our senior notes;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnegatively impact current and prospective customers' willingness to transact business with us;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpose additional insurance, guarantee and collateral requirements;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our access to bank and third-party guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuppliers and financial institutions may lower or eliminate the level of credit provided through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances.. The Debt Ratings have caused some of the effects listed above, and any further downgrades may cause or exacerbate, any of the effects listed above.. -  12  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe have a substantial amount of debt, including secured debt, and we may lose the ability to obtain future financing and suffer competitive disadvantages.. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our total consolidated debt was $7.4 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively.  This substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, distributions, share repurchases, or other purposes;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness, some of which bears interest at variable rates;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to meet financial ratios in the indentures governing certain of our debt or in our bank credit agreements or satisfy certain other conditions included in our bank credit agreements, which could result in our inability to meet requirements for borrowings under our credit agreements or a default under these indentures or agreements, impose restrictions with respect to our access to certain of our capital, and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tif we default under the terms of our secured financing arrangements, the secured debtholders may, among other things, foreclose on the collateral securing the debt, including the applicable drilling units; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than our less levered competitors.. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources and Uses of Liquidity.\". § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. We engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading international oil companies or their affiliates, as well as for many government - controlled oil companies and independent oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, our most significant customers were Chevron, Shell and Petrobras, accounting for approximately 29 percent, 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues.  As of February 19, 2018, the customers with the most significant aggregate amount of contract backlog were Shell, Statoil and Chevron, representing approximately 52 percent, 31 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our total contract backlog.  The loss of any of these customers or another significant customer, or a decline in payments under any of our drilling contracts, could, at least in the short term, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. In addition, our drilling contracts subject us to counterparty risks.  The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the offshore drilling industry, prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the dayrates received and the level of expenses necessary to maintain drilling activities.  In addition, in depressed market conditions, such as we are currently experiencing, our customers may no longer need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling rig at a lower dayrate.  Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated statement of financial condition results of operations or cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWorldwide financial, economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Worldwide financial and economic conditions could restrict our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted, and could in the future impact, the lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  If economic conditions preclude or limit financing from banking institutions participating in our credit facilities, we may not be able to obtain similar financing from other institutions.  A slowdown in economic activity could further reduce worldwide demand for energy and extend or worsen the current period of low oil and natural gas prices.  These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  In addition, turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, North Africa and other geographic areas and countries are adding to overall risk.  An extended period of negative outlook for the world economy could further reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas and for our services.  A further decline in oil and natural gas prices or an extension of the current low oil and natural gas prices could reduce demand for our drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in our operating revenues.. Our operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in our operating revenues.  Costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi - variable regardless of the dayrate being earned.  In addition, should our rigs incur unplanned downtime while on contract or idle time between drilling contracts, we will not always reduce the staff on those rigs because we. -  13  -. Table of Contents. could use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract.  During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate because portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members may be assigned to active rigs or released.  As our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly.  In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation.  Equipment maintenance costs fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment, and these costs could increase for short or extended periods as a result of regulatory or customer requirements that raise maintenance standards above historical levels.  Contract preparation costs vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns.. As of February 19, 2018, we had two ultra - deepwater floater newbuild rigs under construction.  We also have a variety of other more limited shipyard projects at any given time.  These shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshipyard availability, failures and difficulties;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdesign and engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlatent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated actual or purported change orders;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdisputes with shipyards and suppliers;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure or delayed deliveries of significant parts or equipment due to supplier shortages, constraints, disruption or quality issues;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrikes, labor disputes and work stoppages;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcustomer acceptance delays;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse weather conditions, including damage caused by such conditions;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated cost increases; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals.. These factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our newbuild units and other rigs undergoing shipyard projects.  Delayed delivery of these units would impact contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue to us, and may also cause customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses.  In the event of termination of any of these drilling contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all.. Our operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet.  We also rely on the supply of ancillary services, including supply boats and helicopters.  Our reliance on our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub - systems used in our operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items.  Certain parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider.  A disruption in the deliveries from our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment or ancillary services could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations, increase our operating costs and result in increases in rig downtime and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows to the extent the Macondo well's operator fails to indemnify us or is otherwise unable to indemnify us for compensatory damages related to the Macondo well incident as required under the terms of our settlement agreement.. The Macondo well incident resulted in the most extensive spill of hydrocarbons in U.S. history.  Under the Deepwater Horizon drilling contract and in accordance with our settlement agreement with the operator, BP plc (together with its affiliates \"BP\") agreed to indemnify us with respect to certain matters, and we agreed to indemnify BP with respect to certain matters.  We could experience a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows to the extent that BP fails to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations, including by reason of financial or legal restrictions, or our insurance policies do not fully cover these amounts.  In addition, in connection with our settlement with the Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\"), we agreed that we will not use payments pursuant to a civil consent decree by and among the DOJ and certain of our affiliates (the \"Consent Decree\") as a basis for indemnity or reimbursement from non - insurer defendants named in the complaint by the U.S. or their affiliates.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe continuing effects of the enhanced regulations enacted following the Macondo well incident and of agreements applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our worldwide operations.. Following the Macondo well incident, enhanced governmental safety and environmental requirements applicable to both deepwater and shallow water operations were adopted for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  In order to obtain drilling permits, operators must submit applications that demonstrate compliance with the enhanced regulations, which require independent third - party inspections,. -  14  -. Table of Contents. certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout, among other requirements.  Operators have previously had, and may in the future have, difficulties obtaining drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  In addition, the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards, such as the American Petroleum Institute Standard 53 related to the installation and testing of well control equipment.  These safety and environmental guidelines and standards and any further new guidelines or standards the U.S. government or industry may issue or any other steps the U.S. government or industry may take, could disrupt or delay operations, increase the cost of operations, increase out - of - service time or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in the U.S. and non - U.S. offshore areas.. Other governments could take similar actions related to implementing new safety and environmental regulations in the future.  Additionally, some of our customers have elected to voluntarily comply with some or all of the new inspections, certification requirements and safety and environmental guidelines on rigs operating outside of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Additional governmental regulations and requirements concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications and training requirements or the voluntary adoption of such requirements or guidelines by our customers could increase the costs of our operations, increase certification and permitting requirements, increase review periods and impose increased liability on offshore operations.  The continuing effects of the enhanced regulations may also decrease the demand for drilling services, negatively affect dayrates and increase out - of - service time, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompliance with or breach of environmental laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations.. Our business in the offshore drilling industry is affected by laws and regulations relating to the energy industry and the environment, including international conventions and treaties, and regional, national, state, and local laws and regulations.  The offshore drilling industry depends on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and, accordingly, we are directly affected by the adoption of laws and regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and gas.  Compliance with such laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require us to make significant capital expenditures, such as the installation of costly equipment or operational changes, and may affect the resale values or useful lives of our rigs.  We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents.  Offshore drilling in certain areas has been curtailed and, in certain cases, prohibited because of concerns over protection of the environment.  These costs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations.. To the extent new laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore drilling or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the offshore drilling industry, in particular, our business or prospects could be materially adversely affected.  The operation of our drilling rigs will require certain governmental approvals.  These governmental approvals may involve public hearings and costly undertakings on our part.  We may not obtain such approvals or such approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner.  If we fail to timely secure the necessary approvals or permits, our customers may have the right to terminate or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to our detriment.  The amendment or modification of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations curtailing or further regulating exploratory or development drilling and production of oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.  Compliance with any such new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows.. As an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in some offshore areas, we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or waste disposals related to those operations, and we may also be subject to significant fines in connection with spills.  For example, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages, as well as third-party damages, to the extent that the contractual indemnification provisions in our drilling contracts are not enforceable or otherwise sufficient, or if our customers are unwilling or unable to contractually indemnify us from these risks.  Additionally, we may not be able to obtain such indemnities in our future drilling contracts, and our customers may not have the financial capability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us.  Also, these indemnities may be held to be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions, as a result of public policy or for other reasons.  For example, one of the courts in the litigation related to the Macondo well incident refused to enforce aspects of our indemnity with respect to certain environmental - related liabilities.  Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence.  These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed.  The application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements or measures could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. -  15  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe global nature of our operations involves additional risks.. We operate in various regions throughout the world, which may expose us to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tseizure, expropriation or nationalization of our equipment;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpropriation or nationalization of our customers' property;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trepudiation or nationalization of contracts;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of trade or immigration barriers;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timport - export quotas;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twage and price controls;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation and enforcement;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvolvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdamage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcomplications associated with supplying, repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to move income or capital; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency exchange fluctuations and currency exchange restrictions, including exchange or similar controls that may limit our ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of a local jurisdiction.. Our non - U.S. contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the import and export, equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation and social contributions of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel.  We are also subject to the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") and other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations.  In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors have proposed or adopted divestment and other initiatives regarding investments including, with respect to state governments, by state retirement systems in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. State Department.  Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions, may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets.  Investors could view any potential violations of OFAC regulations negatively, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares.. Governments in some countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries, including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts.  Many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require nonlocal contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction or require use of a local agent.  In addition, government action, including initiatives by OPEC, may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility.  In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so.. A substantial portion of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency.  Those amounts may exceed our local currency needs, leading to the accumulation of excess local currency, which, in certain instances, may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to U.S. dollars, our functional currency, or to other currencies in which we operate.  Excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses.. The shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations.  Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate.  Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations.  Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, and we are also subject to the U.S. anti - boycott law.. The laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing.  These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations.  Ongoing economic challenges may increase some governments' efforts to enact, enforce, amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue.  Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes.  Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.. An inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees on a timely basis could impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.  Our ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of, and to work in, the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits.  If we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to operate our rigs on a timely basis, we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts, which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts.  If our customers cancel some of our drilling contracts, and we are unable to secure new drilling contracts on a timely. -  16  -. Table of Contents. basis and on substantially similar terms, it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.. Our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells, such as, blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, craterings, fires, explosions and pollution.  Contract drilling requires the use of heavy equipment and exposure to hazardous conditions, which may subject us to liability claims by employees, customers and other parties.  These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, claims by third parties or customers and suspension of operations.  Our offshore fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, piracy, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations.. The South China Sea, the Northwest Coast of Australia and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are areas subject to typhoons, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis, and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms, some of which may not be covered by insurance.  The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel.  Some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions.  Operations may also be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services, or personnel shortages.  We customarily provide contract indemnity to our customers for certain claims that could be asserted by us relating to damage to or loss of our equipment, including rigs, and claims that could be asserted by us or our employees relating to personal injury or loss of life.. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through spillage of hydrocarbons, fuel, lubricants or other chemicals and substances used in drilling operations, or extensive uncontrolled fires.  We may also be subject to property damage, environmental indemnity and other claims by oil and natural gas companies.  Drilling involves certain risks associated with the loss of control of a well, such as blowout, cratering, the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and remediation of associated pollution.  Our customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us against such risks.  In addition, a court may decide that certain indemnities in our current or future drilling contracts are not enforceable.  The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy, and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other matters may be limited.. Our insurance policies and drilling contracts contain rights to indemnity that may not adequately cover our losses, and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks.  We have two main types of insurance coverage: (1) hull and machinery coverage for physical damage to our property and equipment and (2) excess liability coverage, which generally covers offshore risks, such as personal injury, third - party property claims, and third - party non - crew claims, including wreck removal and pollution.  We generally have no hull and machinery insurance coverage for damages caused by named storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  We maintain per occurrence deductibles that generally range up to $10 million for various third - party liabilities and an additional aggregate annual deductible of $50 million, which is self-insured through our wholly - owned captive insurance company.  We also retain the risk for any liability in excess of our $750 million excess liability coverage.  However, pollution and environmental risks generally are not completely insurable.. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by our insurance or by an enforceable or recoverable indemnity, the occurrence could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The amount of our insurance may also be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss.  Our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations.  Our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits.  As a result, we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits.  We generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue, and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers.  Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs.  In addition, we could decide to retain more risk in the future, resulting in higher risk of losses, which could be material.  Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSwiss corporate governance may affect our business.. The Swiss Federal Council Ordinance Against Excessive Compensation at Public Companies (the \"Ordinance\"), among other things, (a) requires a binding shareholder \"say on pay\" vote with respect to the compensation of members of our executive management and board of directors (b) generally prohibits the making of severance, advance, transaction premiums and similar payments to members of our executive management and board of directors, and (c) requires the declassification of our board of directors and the amendment of our articles of association to specify various compensation - related matters.  At our annual general meetings, our shareholders are required to approve the maximum aggregate compensation of (1) our board of directors for the period through the successive annual general meeting and (2) our executive management team for the following year.  The Ordinance further provides for criminal penalties against directors and members of executive management in case of noncompliance with certain of its requirements.  The Ordinance may negatively affect our ability to retain executive management and members of our board of directors.. -  17  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCorporate restructuring activity, divestitures, acquisitions and other business combinations and reorganizations could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic goals.. We have undertaken and continue to seek appropriate opportunities for restructuring our organization, engaging in strategic acquisitions, divestitures and other business combinations in order to optimize our fleet and strengthen our competitiveness.  We face risks arising from these activities, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic goals.  For example:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to realize the growth or investment opportunities, improvement of our financial position and other expected benefits by these activities in the expected time period or at all;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransactions may not be completed as scheduled or at all due to legal or regulatory requirements, market conditions or contractual and other conditions to which such transactions are subject;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunanticipated problems could also arise in the integration or separation processes, including unanticipated restructuring or separation expenses and liabilities, as well as delays or other difficulties in transitioning, coordinating, consolidating, replacing and integrating personnel, information and management systems, and customer products and services;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe diversion of management and key employees' attention may detract from our ability to increase revenues and minimize costs; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcertain transactions may result in other unanticipated adverse consequences.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to recruit and retain key personnel could hurt our operations.. We depend on the continuing efforts of key members of our management, as well as other highly skilled personnel, to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide.  Historically, competition for the personnel required for drilling operations has intensified as the number of rigs activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover.  We may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover and ongoing staff reduction initiatives, which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents, which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs.  If increased competition for qualified personnel were to intensify in the future we may experience increases in costs or limits on operations.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations.. Approximately 26 percent of our total workforce, working primarily in Brazil, Norway and the U.K. are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work is subject to, collective bargaining agreements, substantially all of which are subject to annual salary negotiation.  These negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses, other increased costs or increased operational restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations affect the market for all offshore employees not just the union members.  Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed.  Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFailure to comply with anti - bribery statutes, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\"Bribery Act\") and similar anti - bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti - bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  If we are found to be liable for violations under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other similar laws, either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including our partners in our various joint ventures, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares.. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets.  Additionally, we could face other third - party claims by agents, shareholders, debt holders, or other interest holders or constituents of our company.  Further, disclosure of the subject matter of any investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business from potential customers or retain existing business from our current customers, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.  Our customers in relevant jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests, and we may be required to dedicate significant time and resources to investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct, regardless of the merit of such allegations.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRegulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.. Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, including greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes.  In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide.. -  18  -. Table of Contents. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun adopting and implementing a comprehensive suite of regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act.  In addition, a number of other federal, state and regional efforts have focused on tracking or reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Efforts have also been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.  In December 2015, the U.S. joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France.  The resulting agreement (the \"Paris Agreement\") calls for the parties to undertake \"ambitious efforts\" to limit the average global temperature and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases.  The U.S. is one of over 70 nations having ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the Paris Agreement.  The greenhouse gas emission reductions called for by the Paris Agreement are not binding.  On June 1, 2017, the U.S. announced its plan to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement.  The Paris Agreement provides for a four - year exit process beginning in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit - date of November 2020.  The U.S.'s adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the U.S. may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement if it chooses to do so, are unclear at this time.. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities.  In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe are subject to litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.. We are subject to a variety of disputes, investigations and litigation.  Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to and have been involved in litigation with certain of our customers.  We have subsidiaries that have issued debt under indentures that are subject to covenant compliance, some of which have been accused of breaching certain requirements of such covenants (see \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies - Global Marine litigation\").  Certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases, such as silicosis, and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time.  Some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets.  Certain subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage.  Our patent for dual - activity technology has been successfully challenged in certain jurisdictions.  We are also subject to a number of significant tax disputes.  We cannot predict the outcome of the cases involving those subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them.  Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases, insurers may not remain solvent and policies may not be located.  Suits against non - asset - owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor - in - interest claims against us and our asset - owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims.  To the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance, a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.. We depend on digital technologies to conduct our offshore and onshore operations, to collect payments from customers and to pay vendors and employees.  Threats to our information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber - incidents or attacks continue to grow.  In addition, breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for some period of time.  Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of intellectual property, proprietary information or customer data; disruption of our customers' operations; loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.  If such a cyber - incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tActs of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Acts of terrorism and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world's financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future.  Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours.  In addition, acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services.  Insurance premiums could increase and coverage may be unavailable in the future.  Government regulations may effectively preclude us from engaging in business activities in certain countries.  These regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future.  Our drilling contracts do not generally provide indemnification against loss of capital assets or loss of revenues resulting from acts of terrorism, piracy or political or social unrest.  We have limited insurance for our assets providing coverage for physical damage losses resulting from risks, such as terrorist acts, piracy, vandalism, sabotage, civil unrest, expropriation and acts of war, and we do not carry insurance for loss of revenues resulting from such risks.. -  19  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tPublic health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results.. Public health threats, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, severe influenza and other highly communicable viruses or diseases, outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate, could adversely impact our operations, the operations of our customers and the global economy, including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services.  Quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our operations.  Travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate, or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future, may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results.. Other risks. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe have significant carrying amounts of long - lived assets that are subject to impairment testing.. At December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of our property and equipment was $17.4 billion, representing 78 percent of our total assets.  In accordance with our critical accounting policies, we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of our assets held and used may not be recoverable.  In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized an aggregate loss of $1.4 billion associated with the impairment of certain assets sold for scrap value or for alternative use, and we recognized a loss of $94 million associated with the impairment of our midwater floater asset group.  In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized an aggregate loss of $52 million associated with the impairment of our deepwater floater asset group, and we recognized a loss of $41 million associated with the impairment of certain assets sold for scrap value.  Future expectations of lower dayrates or rig utilization rates or a significant change to the composition of one or more of our asset groups or to our contract drilling services reporting unit could result in the recognition of additional losses on impairment of our long - lived asset groups if future cash flow expectations, based upon information available to management at the time of measurement, indicate that the carrying amount of our asset groups may be impaired.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have operations, are incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.. We operate worldwide through our various subsidiaries.  Consequently, we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates.  A material change in the tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, of any country in which we have significant operations, or in which we are incorporated or resident, could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results.. The U.S., for example, has enacted tax legislation that eliminates some perceived tax advantages of companies that have legal domiciles outside the U.S., but have certain U.S. connections.  Switzerland, in response to certain guidance from and demands by the European Union (\"EU\") and the Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development (the \"OECD\"), has been carefully considering various tax reform proposals.  Some of these tax reform measures may be adopted into law and effective as early as 2019.  Switzerland's implementation of any material change in tax laws or policies or its adoption of new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Similarly, the OECD issued its action plan of tax reform measures that called for member states to take action to prevent \"base erosion and profit shifting\".  Some of these measures impact transfer pricing, requirements to qualify for tax treaty benefits, and the definition of permanent establishments depending on each jurisdiction's adoption and interpretation of such proposals.  Respective countries have adopted various measures into their own tax laws.  The EU issued its Anti - Tax Avoidance Directive in 2016 that required its member states to adopt specific tax reform measures by 2019.  Any material change in tax laws or policies, or their interpretation, resulting from such legislative proposals or inquiries could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Other tax jurisdictions in which we operate may consider implementing similar legislation.  The implementation of such legislation, any other material changes in tax laws or policies or the adoption of new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings, which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations.. We are a Swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.  Consequently, we are subject to tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate.  Our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries.. -  20  -. Table of Contents. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination.  We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority.  If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure; or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, particularly in the U.S., India, Brazil or Nigeria, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected.  For example, we cannot be certain that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") will not successfully contend that we or any of our key subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. or, when applicable, that we or any of our key subsidiaries maintained or maintain a permanent establishment in the U.S., since, among other things, such determination involves considerable uncertainty.  If we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to have been engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., when applicable, through a permanent establishment, we could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business during the period in which this was considered to have occurred, in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially, and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tU.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which would have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders.. A foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (\"PFIC\") for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75 percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or (2) at least 50 percent of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income.  For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties, but does not include income derived from the performance of services.. We believe that we have not been and will not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year.  Our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC.  Accordingly, we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute \"passive income,\" and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets.. There is significant legal authority supporting this position, including statutory provisions, legislative history, case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization, for other tax purposes, of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services.  It should be noted, however, that a prior case and an IRS pronouncement which relies on the case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes.  However, the IRS subsequently has formally announced that it does not agree with the decision in that case.  Moreover, we believe that the terms of the time charters in the prior case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers.  No assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court could determine that we are a PFIC.. If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. tax consequences.  Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and such elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder, such shareholder generally would be liable to pay U.S. federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions, as defined for U.S. tax purposes, and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares, plus interest on such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder's holding period of our shares.  In addition, under applicable statutory provisions, the preferential tax rate on \"qualified dividend income,\" which applies to dividends paid to non - corporate shareholders does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may be limited in our use of net operating losses and tax credits.. Our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before they expire.  We have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit for a number of our U.S. and non U.S. net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against other U.S. or non - U.S. deferred tax assets if market conditions change materially and, as a result, our future earnings are, or are projected to be, significantly less than we currently estimate.  Our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities of the jurisdictions where these tax attributes are incurred.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAs a Swiss corporation, our flexibility may be limited with respect to certain aspects of capital management, and we may be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.. Under Swiss law, our shareholders may approve an authorized share capital that allows the board of directors to issue new shares without additional shareholder approval.  The authorized share capital is limited to a maximum of 50 percent of a company's registered share capital and is subject to re - approval by shareholders every two years.  Shareholders at our annual general meeting in May 2018 will be requested to approve an authorized share capital since the current authorized share capital will expire on May 12, 2018.  Our current authorized share capital is limited to approximately five percent of our registered share capital.  Additionally, subject to certain. -  21  -. Table of Contents. exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares.  Further, Swiss law does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.  Swiss law also reserves for shareholder approval certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions.  For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders.  These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.. Distributions to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction and dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid - in capital are not currently subject to the 35 percent Swiss federal withholding tax.  However, the Swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future, and any such change may adversely affect us or our shareholders.  In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid - in capital available for us to pay out as distributions is limited.  If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value, or out of qualifying additional paid - in capital as shown on Transocean Ltd.'s standalone Swiss statutory financial statements, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.. Under Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a 35 percent Swiss withholding tax on the repurchase price less the par value to the extent attributable to qualifying additional paid - in capital, if any.  At our 2009 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to CHF 3.5 billion of our shares for cancellation under the share repurchase program.  We may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program using a procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a \"virtual second trading line\" from market players, in particular, banks and institutional investors, who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the Swiss withholding tax.  Our ability to use the \"virtual second trading line\" is limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders, and any use of the \"virtual second trading line\" with respect to future share repurchase programs will require the approval of the competent Swiss tax authorities.  We may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on the \"virtual second trading line\" without subjecting the selling shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAs a Swiss corporation, we are subject to Swiss legal provisions that may limit our flexibility to swiftly implement certain initiatives or strategies.. We are required, from time to time, to evaluate the carrying amount of our investments in affiliates, as presented on our Swiss standalone balance sheet.  If we determine that the carrying amount of any such investment exceeds its fair value, we may conclude that such investment is impaired.  The recognized loss associated with such a non-cash impairment could result in our net assets no longer covering our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves.  Under Swiss law, if our net assets cover less than 50 percent of our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves, the board of directors must in these circumstances convene a general meeting of shareholders and propose measures to remedy such a capital loss.  The appropriate measures depend on the relevant circumstances and the magnitude of the recognized loss and may include seeking shareholder approval for offsetting the aggregate loss, or a portion thereof, with our statutory capital reserves including qualifying additional paid-in capital otherwise available for distributions to shareholders or raising new equity.  Depending on the circumstances, we may also need to use qualifying additional paid - in capital available for distributions in order to reduce our accumulated net loss and such use might reduce our ability to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.  These Swiss law requirements could limit our flexibility to swiftly implement certain initiatives or strategies.. -  22  -. Table of Contents. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe are subject to anti - takeover provisions.. Our articles of association and Swiss law contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise.  These provisions may also adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares.  These provisions, among other things:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that the board of directors is authorized, subject to obtaining shareholder approval every two years, at any time during a maximum two - year period, which under the current authorized share capital of the Company will expire on May 12, 2018, to issue a specified number of shares, which under the current authorized share capital of the Company is approximately five percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register, and to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of existing shareholders in various circumstances;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide for a conditional share capital that authorizes the issuance of additional shares up to a maximum amount of approximately 31  percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register as of February 13, 2018 without obtaining additional shareholder approval through: (1) the exercise of conversion, exchange, option, warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted in connection with bonds, options, warrants or other securities newly or already issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of any of our subsidiaries; or (2) in connection with the issuance of shares, options or other share - based awards;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to the company;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that directors can be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares entitled to vote;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that a merger or demerger transaction requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares represented at the meeting and provide for the possibility of a so - called \"cashout\" or \"squeezeout\" merger if the acquirer controls 90 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprovide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit the ability of our shareholders to amend or repeal some provisions of our articles of association; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit transactions between us and an \"interested shareholder,\" which is generally defined as a shareholder that, together with its affiliates and associates, beneficially, directly or indirectly, owns 15 percent or more of our shares entitled to vote at a general meeting.. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe results of the U.K.'s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the U.K. elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum, and in March 2017, the government of the U.K. formally initiated the process.  The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the March 2017 initiation.  Nevertheless, the referendum has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the U.K. determines which European Union - derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal.  The referendum has also given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal.  These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets.  Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows."
