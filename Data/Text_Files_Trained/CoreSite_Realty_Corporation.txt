[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our Company.. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations. Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of data centers geographically concentrated in certain markets and any adverse developments in local economic conditions or the demand for data center space in these markets may negatively impact our operating results.. Our portfolio of properties consists of data centers geographically concentrated in the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles, the Northern Virginia area (including Washington D.C.), the New York area, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Miami. These markets comprised 30.9%, 25.9%, 19.7%, 7.3%, 7.3%, 7.1%,  1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively, of our annualized data center rent as of December 31, 2017. As such, we are susceptible to local economic conditions and the supply of and demand for data center space in these markets. If there is a downturn in the economy or an oversupply of or decrease in demand for data centers in these markets, our business could be materially adversely affected to a greater extent than if we owned a real estate portfolio that was more diversified in terms of both geography and industry focus.. We may be vulnerable to physical and electronic security breaches and cyber - attacks which could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our infrastructure could misappropriate our proprietary information and the personal information of our customers and employees and cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers' operations. We expend significant financial resources to protect against such threats and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic, and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.. Our properties depend upon the demand for technology - related real estate.. Our portfolio of properties consists primarily of technology - related real estate and data center facilities in particular. A decrease in the demand for data center space, Internet gateway facilities or other technology - related real estate would have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a portfolio with a more diversified customer base or less specialized use. Our substantial development activities make us particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns, including recessions, as well as adverse developments in the corporate data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to markets that we do not currently serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology, such as virtualization technology, more efficient or miniaturization of computing or networking devices, or devices that require higher power densities than today's devices, could also reduce demand for the physical data center space and infrastructure we provide or make the tenant improvements in our facilities obsolete or in need of significant upgrades to remain viable. The development of new technologies, the adoption of new industry standards or other factors could render many of our customers' current products and services obsolete or unmarketable and contribute to a downturn in their businesses, thereby increasing the likelihood that they default under their leases, become insolvent or file for bankruptcy. In addition, existing initiatives relating to the formation of Internet exchange alternatives could have a negative effect on the demand for and pricing of the subset of our interconnection revenue relating to Internet exchanges.. 18. Table of Contents. Our products and services have a long sales cycle that may harm our revenues and operating results.. A customer's decision to lease space in one of our data centers and to purchase additional services typically involves a significant commitment of resources. In addition, some customers will be reluctant to commit to locating in our data centers until they are confident that the data center has adequate network connections. As a result, we have a long sales cycle. Furthermore, we may expend significant time and resources in pursuing a particular sale or customer that ultimately does not result in revenue.. Macroeconomic conditions, including economic and market downturns may further impact this long sales cycle by making it extremely difficult for customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. This could cause customers to slow spending or delay decision - making on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen our sales cycle.. Delays due to the length of our sales cycle may materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results, which could harm our ability to meet our financial forecasts for a given quarter and cause volatility in our stock price.. Our interconnection and value - add power services depend on establishing highly evolved customer ecosystems and we may not be able to establish those ecosystems within a particular market.. One of our corporate objectives is to increase the volume of higher margin interconnection services and value - add power services, as well as to increase rental rates and obtain attractive customers, by developing highly evolved ecosystems comprised of cross - connected customers within each market. We have attained varying levels of success in developing these customer ecosystems across our markets. While we believe that we are able to attract network and cloud deployments and to grow the customer ecosystem to some degree in all markets, it may be difficult in some markets to develop ecosystems on the scale of our most highly evolved interconnected ecosystems due to the presence of incumbent interconnection and network - dense data centers in those markets. Our ability to establish highly interconnected data centers in certain markets may be further negatively impacted by industry consolidation. If we are unable to establish highly evolved customer ecosystems within a particular market, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining customer deployments requiring such ecosystems, and increasing the volume of higher margin interconnection services and value - add power services within that market to levels that are comparable to our most highly evolved interconnected ecosystems, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our data center infrastructure may become obsolete and we may not be able to upgrade our power and cooling systems cost - effectively or at all.. The markets for the data centers that we own and operate, as well as the industries in which our customers operate, are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and changing customer demands. Our ability to deliver technologically sophisticated power and cooling is a significant factor in our customers' decisions to lease space in our data centers. Our data center infrastructure may become obsolete due to the development of new systems that deliver power to, or eliminate heat from, the servers and other customer equipment that we house. Additionally, our data center infrastructure could become obsolete as a result of the development of new technology that requires levels of power and cooling that our facilities are not designed to provide. Our power and cooling systems are also sophisticated, expensive and time consuming to upgrade. Accordingly, we may not be able to efficiently upgrade or change these systems to meet new demands without incurring significant costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. The obsolescence of our power and cooling systems would have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, evolving customer demand could require services or infrastructure improvements that we do not provide or that would be difficult or expensive for us to provide in our current data centers, and we may be unable to adequately adapt our properties or acquire new properties that can compete successfully. We risk losing customers to our competitors if we are unable to adapt within this rapidly evolving marketplace.. Furthermore, potential future regulations that apply to industries we serve may require customers in those industries to seek specific requirements from their data centers that we are unable to provide. These may include physical security requirements applicable to the defense industry and government contractors and privacy and security regulations applicable to the financial services and health care industries. If such regulations were adopted or such extra. 19. Table of Contents. requirements demanded by certain customers, we could lose some customers or be unable to attract new customers in certain industries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Any failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could reduce our revenues, harm our business reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.. Our business depends on providing customers with highly reliable service. We may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thuman error;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpower loss;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tequipment failure;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposure to temperature, humidity, smoke and other environmental hazards;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timproper building maintenance by our landlords in the buildings that we lease;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tphysical, electronic or cyber security breaches;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfire, earthquake, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twater damage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twar, terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsabotage and vandalism.. Problems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. We provide service level commitments to substantially all of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or equipment damage in our data centers could result in billing abatements to these customers. In addition, although we have given such abatements to our customers in the past, there can be no assurance that our customers will accept these abatements as compensation in the future. Service interruptions and equipment failures may also expose us to additional legal liability and damage our brand image and reputation. Service interruptions, especially if significant or frequent, could cause our customers to terminate or not renew their leases. In addition, we may be unable to attract new customers if we have a reputation for significant or frequent service disruptions in our data centers.. We depend on third parties to provide network connectivity within and between certain of our data centers, and any delays or disruptions in this connectivity may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow.. We depend upon carriers and other network providers to deliver network connectivity to customers within our data centers as well as the fiber network interconnection between certain of our data centers. Our hub - and - spoke approach makes us dependent on these third parties to provide these services between our data centers. There can be no assurance that any network provider will elect to offer its services within new data centers that we develop or that once a network provider decides to provide connectivity to or between our data centers, it will continue to do so for any period of time. A significant interruption in or loss of these services could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and have a material adverse effect on our business.. Enabling connectivity within and between our data centers requires construction and operation of a sophisticated redundant fiber network. The construction required to connect our data centers is complex and may involve factors outside of our control, including the availability of construction resources. If highly reliable network connectivity within and between certain of our data centers is not established, is materially delayed, is discontinued or fails, our reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers or retain existing ones.. 20. Table of Contents. We are dependent upon third - party suppliers for power and certain other services, and we are vulnerable to service failures of our third - party suppliers and to price increases by such suppliers.. We rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers, and we cannot ensure that these third parties will deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. Since our properties have access to a finite amount of power, it may be inadequate to support our customer requirements and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to our customers. As current and future customers increase their power usage in our facilities over time, the remaining available power for future customers could limit our ability to grow our business and increase occupancy rates or network density within our existing facilities. At certain of our data centers, our aggregate maximum contractual obligation to provide power and cooling to our customers may exceed the physical capacity at such data centers if customers were to quickly increase their demand for power and cooling. If we are not able to increase the available power and/or cooling or move the customer to another location within our data center portfolio with sufficient power and cooling to meet such demand, we could lose the customer as well as be exposed to liability under our leases. Any such material loss of customers or material liability could adversely affect our results of operations.. In addition, our data centers are susceptible to power shortages and planned or unplanned power outages caused by these shortages. While we attempt to limit exposure to power shortages by using backup generators and batteries, power outages may last beyond our backup and alternative power arrangements, which would harm our customers and our business. In the past, a limited number of our customers have experienced temporary losses of power and/or cooling. Pursuant to the terms of some of our customer leases, continuous or chronic power or cooling outages may give certain of our customers the right to terminate their leases or cause us to incur financial obligations in connection with a power or cooling loss. In addition, any loss of services or equipment damage could reduce the confidence of our customers in our services, thereby impairing our ability to attract and retain customers, which would adversely affect both our ability to generate revenues and our operating results, and harm our reputation.. Furthermore, we may be subject to risks and unanticipated costs associated with obtaining power from various utility companies. Municipal utilities in areas experiencing financial distress may increase rates to compensate for financial shortfalls unrelated to either the cost of production or the demand for electricity. Other utilities that serve our data centers may be dependent on, and sensitive to price increases for a particular type of fuel, such as coal, oil or natural gas. In addition, the price of these fuels and the electricity generated from them could increase as a result of proposed legislative measures related to climate change, including efforts to regulate carbon emissions and increase supply from more expensive renewable energy sources. In any of these cases, increases in the cost of power at any of our data centers would put those locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to data centers served by utilities that can provide less expensive power.. We have begun to procure electricity from renewable energy sources. The costs of procuring such electricity may exceed the costs of procuring electricity from existing sources, such as existing utilities or electric service provided through conventional grids. Efforts to support and enhance renewable electricity generation may increase our costs of electricity above those that would be incurred through procurement of conventional electricity from existing sources.. Because we depend on the development and growth of a balanced customer base, including key customers, failure to attract, grow and retain this base of customers could harm our business and operating results.. Our ability to maximize operating revenues depends on our ability to develop and grow a balanced customer base, consisting of a variety of companies, including enterprises, cloud and IT service providers and network providers. We consider certain of these customers to be key in that they attract and assist in retaining other customers. The more balanced the customer base within each data center, the better we will be able to generate significant interconnection revenues, which in turn increases our overall operating revenues. Our ability to attract customers to our data centers will depend on a variety of factors, including the presence of multiple network carriers and cloud operators, the mix of products and services offered by us, the overall mix of customers, the presence of key customers attracting business through vertical market ecosystems, the data center's operating reliability and security and our ability to effectively market and sell our services. However, some of our customers may face competitive pressures and may ultimately not be successful or may be consolidated through merger or acquisition. If these customers do not continue to use our data centers it may be disruptive to our business. Finally, an uncertain economic climate may harm our ability to attract and retain customers if customers slow spending, or delay decision - making, on our products and services, or if customers begin to have difficulty paying us and we experience increased churn in our customer base. Any of these factors may. 21. Table of Contents. hinder the development, growth and retention of a balanced customer base and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Declining real estate valuations and impairment charges could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.. We periodically review each of our properties for indicators that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. Examples of such indicators may include a significant decrease in the market prices of similar properties, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the property is being used or expected to be used based on the underwriting at the time of acquisition, or a change in its physical condition, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development, or a history of operating or cash flow losses. When such impairment indictors exist, we review an estimate of the future cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the real estate investment's use and eventual disposition and compare the estimated future cash flows to the carrying value of the property. We consider factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If our undiscounted net cash flow evaluation indicates that we are unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Recording an impairment loss would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. The evaluation of estimated future cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. A decline in real estate prices where we operate may cause us to reevaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis. Impairment charges could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our stock.. Potential losses to our properties may not be covered by insurance or may exceed our policy coverage limits.. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses, such as acts of war. Our properties in our portfolio are subject to risks from earthquakes, tropical storms, hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters. While we do carry earthquake, hurricane and flood insurance on our properties, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover such losses. In addition, we may discontinue earthquake, hurricane or flood insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss.. If we experience a loss which is uninsured or which exceeds our policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties.. In addition, even if damage to our properties is covered by insurance, a disruption of our business caused by a casualty event may result in the loss of business or customers. We carry business interruption insurance, but such insurance may not fully compensate us for the loss of business or customers due to an interruption caused by a casualty event.. While we monitor the solvency of our insurance carriers, it can be difficult to evaluate the stability and net assets or capitalization of insurance companies, and any insurer's ability to meet its claim payment obligations. A failure of an insurance company to make payments to us upon an event of loss covered by an insurance policy could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Global economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.. General economic conditions and the cost and availability of capital may be adversely affected in some or all of the markets in which we own properties and conduct our operations. Instability in the U.S., Asian, European and other international financial markets and economies may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our customers, to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis, access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in adverse effects on our, and our customers' financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, our access to funds under our revolving credit facility and other lines of credit we may enter into depend on the ability of the lenders that are parties to such facilities to meet their funding commitments to us. There can be no assurance that long - term disruptions in the global economy and the return of tighter credit conditions, and potential failures or nationalizations of, third party financial institutions as a result of such disruptions will not have an adverse. 22. Table of Contents. effect on our lenders. If our lenders are not able to meet their funding commitments to us, our business, results of operation, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to continue operating our business and are unable to borrow additional funds, access our existing lines of credit or raise equity or debt capital, we may need to find alternative ways to increase our liquidity. Such alternatives may include, without limitation, curtailing development activity, disposing of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms or entering into or renewing leases on less favorable terms than we otherwise would.. The market price of our stock may continue to be highly volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the closing sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") has ranged from $80.61 to $119.54 per share. The market price of the shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. General economic and market conditions, and market conditions for telecommunications and real estate stocks in general, may affect the market price of our common stock.. Announcements by us or others, or speculations about our future plans, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These may relate to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating results or forecasts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnew issuances of equity, debt or convertible debt by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to our capital allocation or business strategies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopments in our relationships with our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by our customers or competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in regulatory policy or interpretation (including changes in federal, state, and local tax policies);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental investigations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlitigation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the ratings of our debt or stock by rating agencies or securities analysts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market interest rates or other general market and economic conditions, including inflationary concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our distribution rate as a percentage of stock price relative to market interest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour purchase or development of real estate and/or additional data centers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall market demand for data center space and services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in prices for utilities, connectivity and other services we provide;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpersonnel changes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in customers' budgets for information technology services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour acquisitions of complementary businesses or dispositions of properties; or. 23. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe operational performance of our data centers.. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging telecommunications and real estate companies, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. To fund our growth strategy and refinance our indebtedness, we depend on external sources of capital, which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\") to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income annually, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. We will also be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, including any net capital gains. These distribution requirements may limit our ability to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, from operating cash flow. Consequently, we intend to rely on third - party sources for debt or equity financing to fund our growth strategy. In addition, we may need external sources of capital to refinance our indebtedness at maturity. We may not be able to obtain such financing or refinancing on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third - party sources of capital depends, in part, on:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and financial market conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimited subset of lenders that have historically committed debt capital to REITs that own technology based real estate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market's perception of our growth potential;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour then current debt levels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour historical and expected future earnings, cash flow and cash distributions; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market price per share of our capital stock.. In addition, our ability to access additional capital may be limited by the terms of our existing indebtedness, which restricts our incurrence of additional indebtedness. If we cannot obtain capital when needed, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities arise or refinance our debt at maturity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our level of indebtedness and debt service obligations could have adverse effects on our business.. As of December 31, 2017, we had total principal indebtedness of approximately $944.5 million and the ability to borrow up to an additional $175.6 million under our revolving credit facility, subject to satisfying certain financial and covenant tests. While there are limits in our revolving credit facility and senior unsecured term loans on the amount of debt that we may incur, and additional limits on our indebtedness which may be imposed by future agreements or by a policy adopted by our board of directors, we have the ability to increase our indebtedness over current levels. A substantial increase in our indebtedness may have adverse consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition because it could, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including to pay dividends on our common stock as currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility;. 24. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpose us to increases in interest rates for our variable rate debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all to expand our business or ease liquidity constraints;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity on the same or more favorable terms or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less indebtedness; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to dispose of one or more of our properties at disadvantageous prices or raise equity that may dilute the value of our common stock in order to service our indebtedness or to raise funds to pay such indebtedness at maturity.. The agreements governing our indebtedness place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, reducing operational flexibility and creating default risks.. The agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that place restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These covenants may restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries' assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional debt, including use of our existing capacity under our revolving credit facility;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments or acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens on our or our subsidiaries' assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake capital expenditures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchange the nature of our business.. These covenants could impair our ability to grow our business, take advantage of attractive business opportunities or successfully compete. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios or tests may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default. Cross - default provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt, the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure that debt, including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our data centers, and our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full.. 25. Table of Contents. Fluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our financial results.. Because a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. Based on our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017, if interest rates were to increase by 1%, the corresponding increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately $4.9 million per year. If the United States Federal Reserve increases short - term interest rates, this would have a significant upward impact on shorter - term interest rates, including the interest rates that our variable rate debt is based upon. Potential future increases in interest rates and credit spreads may increase our interest expense and therefore negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, and reduce our access to the debt or equity capital markets.. Any interest rate hedging transactions involve costs and may limit our gains or result in material losses.. Hedging agreements enable us to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate liabilities or fixed rate liabilities to floating rate liabilities. We may use derivatives to hedge our liabilities from time to time. Any hedging transactions into which we enter could expose us to certain risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlosses on a hedge position reducing the cash available for distribution to stockholders and such losses exceeding the amount invested in such instruments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcounterparties to a hedging arrangement defaulting on their obligations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpaying certain fees, such as transaction or brokerage fees; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincurring costs if we elect to terminate a hedging agreement early.. As of December 31, 2017, we are a party to a five - year interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate on $50 million of outstanding debt at approximately 2.98% per annum through January 31, 2019, and a five - year interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate on $75 million of outstanding debt at approximately 2.93% per annum through May 5, 2020.. Our growth depends on the successful development of our properties and any delays or unexpected costs associated with such projects may harm our growth prospects, future operating results and financial condition.. As of December 31, 2017, we had the ability to expand our operating data center square footage by approximately 1,516,000 NRSF, or 67%, as set forth in our development table in Item 1. Our growth depends upon the successful completion of the development of this space and similar projects in the future. Current and future development projects and expansion into new markets will involve substantial planning, allocation of significant company resources and certain risks, including risks related to the acquisition of real property, financing, zoning, regulatory approvals, construction costs and delays. These projects will also require us to carefully select and rely on the experience of one or more general contractors and associated subcontractors during the construction process. Should a general contractor or significant subcontractor experience financial or other problems during the construction process, we could experience significant delays, increased costs to complete the project and other negative impacts to our expected financial returns. Site selection in current and expansion markets is also a critical factor in our expansion plans, and there may not be suitable properties available in our markets at a location that is attractive to our customers and has the necessary combination of access to multiple network providers, a significant supply of electrical power, high ceilings and the ability to sustain heavy floor loading. Furthermore, while we may prefer to locate new data centers adjacent to or in close proximity to our existing data centers, we may be limited by the size and location of suitable properties.. In addition, we will be subject to risks and, potentially, unanticipated costs associated with obtaining access to a sufficient amount of power from local utilities, including the need, in some cases, to develop utility substations on our properties in order to accommodate our power needs, constraints on the amount of electricity that a particular locality's power grid is capable of providing at any given time, and risks associated with the negotiation of long - term power contracts with utility providers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate such contracts on acceptable terms or at all. Any inability to negotiate utility contracts on a timely basis or on acceptable financial terms or in volumes sufficient to supply the requisite power for our development properties would have a material negative impact on our growth and future results of operations and financial condition.. 26. Table of Contents. These and other risks could result in delays or increased costs or prevent the completion of our development projects, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or pay dividends.. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties.. We continually evaluate the market for available properties and may acquire data centers or properties suited for data center development when opportunities exist. Our ability to acquire attractive properties on favorable terms and successfully develop and operate them involves significant risks including, but not limited to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other data center companies or real estate investors with more capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teven if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price of such property;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to realize the intended benefits from acquisitions or achieve anticipated operating or financial results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may underestimate the costs to make necessary improvements to acquired properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations resulting in disruptions to our operations or diversion of our management's attention from our core business activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquired properties may be subject to tax reassessments, which may result in higher than expected real estate tax payments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to access sufficient power on favorable terms or at all; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates.. In the past we have acquired properties that did not perform to our expectations and there can be no assurance that this will not happen again. If we are unable to successfully acquire, develop and operate data center properties, our ability to grow our business, compete and meet market expectations will be significantly impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. We may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities related to properties or businesses that we acquire for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers.. Assets and entities that we have acquired or may acquire in the future, including the properties contributed by the Funds or their affiliates, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse against the sellers. Unknown or contingent liabilities might include liabilities for clean - up or remediation of environmental conditions, claims of customers, vendors or other persons dealing with the acquired entities, tax liabilities and other liabilities whether incurred in the ordinary course of business or otherwise. In the future we may enter into transactions with limited representations and warranties or with representations and warranties that do not survive the closing of the transactions, in which event we would have no or limited recourse against the sellers of such properties. While we usually require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive, such indemnification (including the indemnification by the Funds or their affiliates) is often limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses.. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties. In addition, the total amount of costs and expenses that we may incur with respect to liabilities associated with acquired properties and entities may exceed our expectations, which may adversely. 27. Table of Contents. affect our operating results and financial condition. Finally, indemnification agreements between us and the sellers typically provide that the sellers will retain certain specified liabilities relating to the assets and entities acquired by us. While the sellers are generally contractually obligated to pay all losses and other expenses relating to such retained liabilities, there can be no guarantee that such arrangements will not require us to incur losses or other expenses as well.. Under the contribution agreement pursuant to which the Funds or their affiliates contributed the properties that comprise our portfolio to the Operating Partnership, each of the Funds or their affiliates made certain representations and warranties as to certain material matters related to the property being contributed by such fund or affiliate such as title to any owned property, compliance with laws (including environmental laws) and the enforceability of certain material customer contracts and leases. These representations and warranties made by the Funds or their affiliates have since expired without our becoming aware of any breach. Therefore, we have no further recourse against the contributors under the contribution agreement.. Our data center properties are not suitable for use other than as data centers, which could make it difficult to sell or reposition them if we are not able to lease available space and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our data centers are designed solely to house and run computer servers and related information technology equipment and, therefore, contain extensive electrical and mechanical systems and infrastructure. As a result, they are not suited for use by customers as anything other than as data centers and major renovations and expenditures would be required in order for us to re - lease vacant space for more traditional uses, or for us to sell a property to a buyer for use other than as a data center.. We continue to make significant investments in our back office information technology systems. Any difficulties or disruptions to these efforts may interrupt our normal operations, resulting in an adverse effect to our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.. Over the past several years, we have made significant investments to overhaul our back office information technology systems and expect such investments to continue for the foreseeable future for ongoing improvements to the customer experience. Difficulties with our systems may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We may need to expend significant attention, time and resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing various functions. Such significant investments in our back office systems may take longer to complete and cost more than originally planned. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits we hoped to achieve and we may recognize additional impairment charges if we decide that portions of these information technology system projects will not ultimately benefit the Company or are de - scoped. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $0.3 million of impairment charges, respectively, as a result of internal - use software previously under development that was discontinued and will no longer be placed into service. During the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, we did not recognize any impairment charges on internal-use software.. We are continuing to invest in our expansion efforts, but we may not have sufficient customer demand in the future to realize expected returns on these investments.. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to commit substantial operational and financial resources to develop new data centers and expand existing ones. However, we typically do not require pre - leasing commitments from customers before we develop or expand a data center, and we may not have sufficient customer demand to lease the new data center space when completed. Once development of a data center is complete, we incur a certain amount of operating expenses even if there are no customers occupying the space. A lack of customer demand for data center space or excess capacity in the data center market could impair our ability to achieve our expected rate of return on our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and the market price of our common stock.. We face significant competition and may be unable to lease vacant space, renew existing leases or release space as leases expire, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of technology - related real estate and data centers, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets. In addition, we may face competition from new entrants into the data center market. Some of our competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater. 28. Table of Contents. name recognition, longer operating histories, lower operating costs, pre - existing relationships with current or potential customers, greater financial, marketing and other resources, access to better networks and access to less expensive power. These advantages could allow our competitors to respond more quickly or effectively to strategic opportunities or changes in our industries or markets. If our competitors offer data center space that our existing or potential customers perceive to be superior to ours based on numerous factors, including cost and availability of power, security considerations, location or network connectivity, or if they offer rental rates below our current market rates, we may lose existing or potential customers, incur costs to improve our properties or be forced to reduce our rental rates. This risk is compounded by the fact that a significant percentage of our customer leases expire every year. For example, as of December 31, 2017, data center leases representing 33.7%, 19.6% and 16.1% of our total portfolio annualized rent will expire during 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our existing customers do not renew their leases or we are unable to lease vacant data center space or re - lease data center space for which leases are scheduled to expire at or above current lease rates, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Future consolidation in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.. Mergers or consolidations of technology companies in the future could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. In addition, our competitors may consolidate to improve their portfolios and products offered. Any of these developments could cause our customers to discontinue or reduce the use of our data centers in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.. We have government customers, which subjects us to risks including early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.. We derive some revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and their respective agencies. Some of these customers may terminate all or part of their contracts at any time, without cause.. There is increased pressure for governments and their agencies to reduce spending. Some of our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, some of our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations.. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.. A small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of any of these customers could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our operating revenue. Our top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 34.6% of our total portfolio annualized rent as of December 31, 2017. Some of our customers may experience a downturn in their businesses or other factors that may weaken their financial condition and result in them failing to make timely rental payments, defaulting on their leases, reducing the level of interconnection services they obtain or the amount of space they lease from us or terminating their relationship with us. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or a significant customer exerting significant pricing pressure on us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. In addition, our largest customers may choose to develop new data centers or expand existing data centers of their own. In the event that any of our key customers were to do so, it could result in a loss of business to us or increase pricing pressure on us. If we lose a customer, there is no guarantee that we would be able to replace that customer at a comparative rental rate or at all.. Some of our largest customers may also compete with one another in various aspects of their businesses. The competitive pressures on our customers may have a negative impact on our operations. For instance, one customer could. 29. Table of Contents. determine that it is not in that customer's interest to house mission - critical servers or other telecommunications or information technology equipment in a facility operated by the same company that relies on a key competitor for a significant part of its operating annual revenue. Our loss of a large customer for this or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer may adversely affect the income produced by our properties.. If any customer becomes a debtor in a case under the federal Bankruptcy Code, we cannot evict the customer solely because of the bankruptcy. In addition, the bankruptcy court might authorize the customer to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against the customer for unpaid, future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. In either case, our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full. As of December 31, 2017, we had no material customers in bankruptcy. Our revenues and cash available for distribution could be materially adversely affected if any of our significant customers were to become bankrupt or insolvent, or suffer a downturn in their business, or fail to renew their lease or renew on terms less favorable to us than their current terms.. If we are unable to recruit or retain qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.. We must continue to identify, hire, train, and retain IT professionals, technical engineers, operations employees, and sales, marketing, finance and senior management personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who can provide the technical, strategic and marketing skills required for our Company to grow. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent. The failure to recruit and retain personnel, including, but not limited to, members of our executive team, could harm our business and our ability to grow our Company.. We do not own all of the buildings in which our data centers are located. Instead, we lease certain of our data center space and the ability to renew these leases could be a significant risk to our ongoing operations.. We do not own the buildings for six of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all. The following table summarizes the remaining primary term and renewal rights associated with each of our leased properties:.

(1) \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFMR represents \"fair market rent\" as determined by mutual agreement between landlord and tenant, or in the case of a disagreement, mutual agreement by third party appraisers.. When the primary terms of our leases expire, we generally have the right to extend the terms of our leases as indicated above. For two of these leases, the rent will be determined based on the fair market value of rental rates for the property and the then prevailing rental rates may be higher than rental rates under the applicable lease. To maintain the operating profitability associated with our present cost structure, we must increase operating revenues within existing data centers to offset any potential increase in lease payments at the end of the original and renewal terms. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset these projected higher lease costs would adversely impact our operating income. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain good working relationships with the landlords of our leased properties, which would adversely affect our relationship with our customers and could result in the loss of current customers.. 30. Table of Contents. If we are not able to renew the lease at any of our data centers, the costs of relocating the equipment in such data centers and developing a new location into a high - quality data center could be prohibitive. In addition, we could lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by the relocation. We could also lose those customers that choose our data centers based primarily on their locations.. Increases in our property and other state and local taxes could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders if they cannot be passed on to our customers.. We are subject to a variety of state and local taxes, including real and personal property taxes and sales and use taxes that may increase materially due to factors outside our control. In particular, real estate taxes on our properties may increase as tax rates change and as the properties are assessed or reassessed by taxing authorities. For example, in the State of California various groups have proposed repealing Proposition 13, which limits annual real estate tax increases to 2% of assessed value per annum. Such initiatives, if successful, would increase the assessed value and/or tax rates applicable to commercial property in California, including our data center properties. We expect to be notified by local taxing authorities that the assessed values of certain of our properties have increased. We plan to appeal these increased assessments, but we may not be successful in our efforts. Our leases with our customers generally do not allow us to increase their rent as a result of an increase in real estate or other taxes. If real estate or other taxes increase and we cannot pass these increases on to our customers through increased rent for new leases or upon lease renewals, our result of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected.. We are exposed to potential risks from errors in our financial reporting systems and controls, including the potential for material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to evaluate their internal control over financial reporting. We performed our evaluation as of December 31, 2017, and concluded internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively. Although we believe our internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively, in the course of our internal audit program we have identified certain areas for ongoing improvement and we are in the process of evaluating and designing enhanced business processes and internal controls to address such areas, none of which we believe constitutes a material change. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective or sufficient for us, or our independent registered public accounting firm, to issue unqualified audit reports in the future, especially as our business continues to grow and evolve and if we acquire other businesses.. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our internal reporting systems and controls. We may not be able to implement improvements to our internal reporting systems and controls in an efficient and timely manner and have in the past, and may in the future, discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In addition, internal reporting systems and controls are subject to human error. Any such deficiencies could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, which might involve restating previously issued financial statements. Additionally, as we expand, we will need to implement new systems to support our financial reporting business processes and controls. We may not be able to implement these systems such that errors would be identified in a timely manner, which could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.. Our expenses may not decrease if our revenue decreases.. Most of the expenses associated with our business, such as debt service payments, real estate, personal property and ad valorem taxes, insurance, utilities, employee wages and benefits and corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily decrease in tandem with a reduction in revenue from our business. Our expenses also will be affected by inflationary increases and certain of our costs may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. As a result, we may not be able to fully offset our costs by higher lease rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.. Environmental problems are possible and can be costly.. Environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or. 31. Table of Contents. petroleum product releases at or from the property. In addition, we could incur costs to comply with such laws and regulations, the violation of which could lead to substantial fines and penalties.. We may have to pay governmental entities or third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs that they incurred in connection with any contamination at our current and former properties without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by these environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean - up costs incurred.. Some of our properties contain or may contain asbestos - containing building materials. Environmental laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to properly manage and maintain these materials, notify and train persons who may come into contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions, and third parties could potentially seek recovery from owners or operators for any personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos - containing building materials.. Some of our properties may also contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our customers, employees of our customers and others if property damage or health concerns arise.. We may be adversely affected by regulations related to climate change.. Climate change regulation is a rapidly developing area. New laws relating to climate change, including potential cap - and - trade systems, carbon taxes and other requirements relating to reduction of carbon footprints and/or greenhouse gas emissions all could negatively affect our business operations, results of operations and cash flow. Other countries have enacted climate change laws and regulations and the United States has been involved in discussions regarding international climate change treaties. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and some of the states and localities in which we operate, have also enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and/or have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Our data centers consume significant amounts of power. These laws and regulations could limit our ability to develop new facilities or result in substantial compliance costs, retrofit costs and construction costs, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. We could also face a negative impact on our reputation with the public and our customers if we violate climate change laws or regulations.. We may incur significant costs complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar laws, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.. Under the ADA, all places of public accommodation must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties. We have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with the ADA. If one of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA, we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Additional federal, state and local laws may require modifications to our properties, or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA and any other similar legislation, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. We may incur significant costs complying with other regulations.. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, such as state and local fire and life safety regulations. If one of our properties is not in compliance with these various regulations, we may be required to pay fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing regulations will change or whether future regulations will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will materially adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. 32. Table of Contents. We may be subject to securities class action and other litigation, which may harm our business and operating results.. We may be subject to securities class action or other litigation from time to time. Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and/or damages, and divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.. We may also be called on to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business operations. Some of these claims may seek significant damage amounts due to the nature of our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such current or future proceedings. A future unfavorable outcome in a legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, current and future litigation, regardless of its merits, could result in substantial legal fees, settlement or judgment costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.. We are subject to periodic litigation, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.. From time to time, we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business including securities class action litigation. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. We are currently involved in material legal proceedings. For a detailed discussion of our current material legal proceedings, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in Part I of this Form 10-K. An unfavorable outcome in these proceedings or any future legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.. Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure. Our Board of Directors may change our major corporate, investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and those changes may adversely affect our business.. Our Board of Directors will determine our major corporate policies, including our acquisition, investment, financing, growth, operations and level of indebtedness and distribution policies and whether to maintain our status as a REIT. Our Board of Directors may alter or eliminate our current corporate policies, including our policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. Accordingly, while our stockholders have the power to elect or remove directors, our stockholders will have limited direct control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.. The Funds and their affiliates own approximately 28.9% of our Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2017, and have the right to nominate one director for so long as they hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock or common stock equivalents. Their interests may differ from or conflict with the interests of our stockholders.. As of December 31, 2017, the Funds or their affiliates had an aggregate beneficial common ownership interest in our Operating Partnership of approximately 28.9% which, if exchanged for our common stock, would represent approximately 28.7% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, the operating agreement for our Operating Partnership grants the Funds and their affiliates the right to nominate one of the eight directors to our Board of Directors for so long as the Funds hold at least 10% of our outstanding common stock or common stock equivalents. As a result, the Funds and their affiliates have the ability to exercise substantial influence over our Company, including with respect to decisions relating to our capital structure, issuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, paying dividends, incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, selling properties or other assets, merging with other companies and undertaking other extraordinary transactions. In any of these matters, the interests of the Funds and their affiliates may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, the Funds and their affiliates are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or. 33. Table of Contents. potential customers. The Funds and their affiliates may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue.. Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.. Our charter and bylaws contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur Charter Contains Restrictions on the Ownership and Transfer of Our Stock.  In order to assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of REIT stock imposed by the Code on REITs, our charter generally prohibits any person or entity (other than a person who or entity that has been granted an exception as described below) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our common stock, or more than 9.8% (by value) of our capital stock. The value and number of the outstanding shares of common stock, and the value of the outstanding shares of capital stock shall be determined by the Board of Directors in good faith, which shall be conclusive for all purposes. We refer to these restrictions as the ownership limits. Our charter permits our Board of Directors to make, and our Board of Directors has made, certain exceptions to these ownership limits, where our Board of Directors has determined that such exceptions would not cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our capital stock in excess of the ownership limits without the consent of our Board of Directors will result in the automatic transfer of the shares (and all dividends thereon) to a charitable trust. These ownership limitations may prevent a third party from acquiring control of us if our Board of Directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limitations, even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur Charter Grants Our Board of Directors the Right to Classify or Reclassify Any Unissued Shares of Capital Stock, Increase or Decrease the Authorized Number of Shares and Establish the Preference and Rights of Any Preferred Stock without Stockholder Approval.  Our charter provides that the total number of shares of stock of all classes that we currently have authority to issue is 120,000,000, initially consisting of 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without a stockholders' vote, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock, into preferred stock or vice versa, to increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of common stock and preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock or other class or series of shares to be issued. Because our Board of Directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholders' vote, our Board of Directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.. Certain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.. Certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then - prevailing market price of such shares, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\"business combination\" provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \"interested stockholder\" (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two - year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and thereafter imposes two super - majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\"control share\" provisions that provide that \"control shares\" of our Company (defined as voting shares of stock which, when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to. 34. Table of Contents. exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \"control share acquisition\" (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of \"control shares\") have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two - thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.. We have opted out of these provisions of the MGCL, in the case of the business combination provisions of the MGCL, by resolution of our Board of Directors and, in the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, by a provision in our bylaws. However, our Board of Directors may elect to opt into these provisions, if approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast and with the consent of the Funds or their affiliates, provided that the consent of the Funds will not be required unless, in the case of the control share provisions, such provisions would apply to the Funds and their affiliates or in either case at such time they own less than 10% of our outstanding common stock (assuming all common Operating Partnership units are exchanged into common stock).. Additionally, the MGCL permits our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defenses, such as a classified board, some of which we do not yet have.. The Company's rights and the rights of its stockholders to take action against its directors and officers are limited.. According to Maryland law, our Board of Directors have no liability in their capacities as directors if they perform their duties in good faith, in a manner they reasonably believe to be in the Company's best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. As permitted by the MGCL, the Company's charter limits the liability of its directors and officers to the Company and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated.. Additionally, the charter authorizes the Company to obligate itself, and the bylaws require it, to indemnify the Company's directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and we have entered into indemnification agreements with the Company's officers and directors. As a result, the Company and its stockholders may have more limited rights against its directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. Accordingly, in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of the Company's directors or officers impede the performance of the Company, a stockholders' ability to recover damages from that director or officer will be limited.. The number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. We cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, either by us or by holders of Operating Partnership units upon exchange of such Operating Partnership units for our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock. The Funds, as holders of the Operating Partnership units issued in the formation transactions, have the right to require us to register with the SEC the resale of the common stock issuable, if we so elect, upon redemption of these Operating Partnership units. In addition, we registered shares of common stock that we have reserved for issuance under our Long Term Incentive Plan, and they generally can be freely sold in the public market, assuming any applicable restrictions and vesting requirements are satisfied. If any or all of these holders, including the Funds, cause a large number of their shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and could impede our ability to raise future capital. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 15,011 common Operating Partnership units held by third parties were redeemed for shares of our common stock. Refer to Item 8 - Note 11 Noncontrolling Interests - Operating Partnership in \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" included in this Annual Report.. 35. Table of Contents. Failure to qualify as a REIT would have material adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock.. We have elected to be taxed and to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. However, there can be no assurance that we will remain qualified as a REIT. If, in any taxable year, we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax, including any alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.. Our failure to qualify as a REIT could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.. Failure to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT could subject our non - U.S. stockholders to adverse federal income tax consequences.. We will remain a domestically controlled REIT if, at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of our shares is held directly or indirectly by non - U.S. stockholders. However, because our shares are publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain the qualifications to be a domestically - controlled REIT. If we fail to qualify as a domestically - controlled REIT, our non - U.S. stockholders that otherwise would not be subject to federal income tax on the gain attributable to a sale of our shares of common stock would be subject to taxation upon such a sale if either (1) the shares of common stock were not considered to be regularly traded under applicable Treasury Regulations on an established securities market, such as the NYSE, or (2) the selling non - U.S. stockholder owned, actually or constructively, more than 5% in value of the outstanding shares of common stock being sold during specified testing periods. If gain on the sale or exchange of our shares of common stock was subject to taxation for these reasons, the non - U.S. stockholder would be subject to regular U.S. income tax with respect to any gain on a net basis in a manner similar to the taxation of a taxable U.S. stockholder, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals, and corporate non - U.S. stockholders may be subject to an additional branch profits tax.. Our cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay distributions at expected levels or at all, and we may be required to borrow funds on a short - term basis during unfavorable market conditions.. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required under the Code to distribute at least 90% of our net taxable income annually to our stockholders. In any period our net taxable income may be greater than our cash flow from operations, requiring us to fund such distributions from other sources, including borrowed funds, even if the market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. In addition, we may become party to debt agreements that include cash management or similar provisions, pursuant to which revenues generated by properties subject to such indebtedness are immediately, or upon the occurrence of certain events, swept into an account for the benefit of the lenders under such debt agreements, which revenues would typically only become available to us after the funding of reserve accounts for, among other things, debt service, taxes, insurance and leasing commissions. In any event, if our properties do not generate sufficient distributable cash flow to satisfy our REIT distribution obligations, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, the sale of assets or debt or equity financing, some or all of which may not be available or may not be available on favorable market conditions. As a result, any failure to generate cash greater than our REIT distribution obligation could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, the maximum tax rate applicable to \"qualified dividends\" paid to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 23.8% (taking into account the 3.8%. 36. Table of Contents. Medicare tax applicable to net investment income). Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the same reduced tax rate. Rather, as provided for in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law December 22, 2017, REIT dividends will be subject to tax at rates applicable to ordinary income reduced by 20%, resulting in rates as high as 33.4% (taking into account the 3.8% Medicare tax applicable to net investment income). The more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non - REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common shares.. Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us.. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect our stockholders, Operating Partnership unit holders and/or us. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors and/or us. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.. If tax rates were to change in a manner comparably favorable for regular corporate taxable income and dividends to that of REITs, investors could perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investment in dividend paying non-REIT corporations, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. Stockholders and potential investors should consult their tax advisors regarding their respective tax considerations and rates.. Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.. As a REIT we are subject to various restrictions on our income, assets and activities. These include restrictions on our ability to pursue certain strategic acquisitions or business combinations and our ability to enter into other lines of business. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will conduct certain business activities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income at applicable corporate income tax rates. However, we may still be limited in the business activities we can pursue.. Despite our REIT status, we remain subject to various taxes.. Notwithstanding our status as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, we will pay tax on certain types of income that we do not distribute and we will incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with our taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\") entities that are not conducted on an arm's length basis. Moreover, our TRS entities are taxable as regular C corporations and will pay federal, state and local income tax on their net taxable income at the applicable corporate rates.. We could become subject to the imposition of prohibited transactions tax.. In the event a determination were made that we executed a prohibited transaction, defined as a sale or disposition of property held for sale in the ordinary course of business other than foreclosed property, a federal tax would be imposed on 100% of the net income derived from such a transaction. Safe - harbor rules exist to avoid the prohibited transaction test. Otherwise, facts and circumstances would govern application of the tax to a particular transaction.. If the structural components of our properties were not treated as real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.. A significant portion of the value of our properties is attributable to structural components related to the provision of electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, humidification regulation, security and fire protection, and telecommunication services. We have received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\"), holding, among other things, that our buildings, including the structural components, constitute real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements. We are entitled to rely upon that private letter ruling only to the extent that we did not misstate or omit a material fact in the ruling request we submitted to the IRS and that we operate in the future in accordance with the material facts described in that request. Moreover, the IRS, in its sole discretion, may. 37. Table of Contents. revoke the private letter ruling. If our structural components are subsequently determined not to constitute real property for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements, including as a result of our being unable to rely upon the private letter ruling or the IRS revoking that ruling, we would fail to qualify as a REIT, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock.. If interconnection services were not treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT qualification requirements, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.. Interconnection services are a fundamental and growing part of our business. Based on representations we have made to the IRS that this activity is ordinary, necessary, usual, and customary in connection with the operation of our data center properties and those properties with similar character to ours, we have received a private letter ruling, holding, among other things, that amounts received from our customers for interconnection services will not be treated as other than \"rents from real property\" under the Code. We are entitled to rely upon that private letter ruling only to the extent that we did not misstate or omit a material fact in the ruling request we submitted to the IRS and that we operate in the future in accordance with the material facts described in that request. Moreover, the IRS, in its sole discretion, may revoke the private letter ruling. If the revenue associated with our interconnection activity was determined to be non - qualifying REIT income, including as a result of our being unable to rely upon the private letter ruling or the IRS revoking that ruling, there would be significant risk to our ability to qualify as a REIT, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock.. Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, our sources of income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our capital stock. If we fail to comply with one or more of the asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of such calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our financial performance and reduce amounts available for distribution to our stockholders."
