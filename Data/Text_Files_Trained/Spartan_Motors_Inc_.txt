[1] "Item 1A. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Factors.. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. The risks described below are the risks known to us that we believe could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, these risks may not be the only risks we face. Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us, factors we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations, or factors that emerge as new risks in the future.. We depend on local and municipal governments for a substantial portion of our business.. In 2017, local and municipal governments were the end customer for 42% of our revenue, including custom fire truck chassis, fire truck bodies, aerial ladders and other fire truck related apparatus.  These markets are heavily impacted by municipal capital spending budgets, which may be impacted by fluctuating municipal tax revenues.  These budgetary constraints may have a significant adverse effect on the overall fire and emergency vehicle market and/or cause a shift in the fire and emergency vehicle market away from highly customized products toward commercially produced vehicles.  These changes could result in weakened demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our net sales, financial condition, profitability and/or cash flows.. The integration of businesses or assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future involves challenges that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.. As part of our growth strategy, we have pursued and expect we will continue to selectively pursue, acquisitions of businesses or assets in order to diversify, expand our capabilities, enter new markets, or increase our market share.  Integrating any newly acquired business or assets can be expensive and can require a great deal of management time and other resources.  If we are unable to successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses with our existing business, we may not realize the synergies we expect from the acquisition and our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.. Re-configuration or relocation of our production operations could negatively impact our earnings.. We may, from time to time, re-configure our production lines or relocate production of products between buildings or locations or to new locations in order to maximize the efficient utilization of our existing production capacity or take advantage of opportunities to increase manufacturing efficiencies.  Costs incurred to effect these re-configurations or re-locations may exceed our estimate, and efficiencies gained may be less than anticipated, each of which may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position.. Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.. We rely, for certain of our products, on a network of independent dealers to market, deliver, provide training for, and service our products to and for customers.  Our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers.. From time to time, we or an individual dealer may choose to terminate the relationship, or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership.  In addition, our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert our dealers to carry their products.  We do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business.. However, disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.  In the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty, we may choose to provide financial support, such as extending credit, to a dealership, reducing the risk of disruption, but increasing our financial exposure.. We may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy.. Our growth strategy includes expanding existing market share through product innovation, continued expansion into industrial and global markets, and merger or acquisition related activities.. 13. We believe our future success depends in part on our research and development and engineering efforts, our ability to manufacture or source the products and customer acceptance of our products.  As it relates to new markets, our success also depends on our ability to create and implement local supply chain, sales and distribution strategies to reach these markets.. The potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.  The successful implementation of our growth strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate operations with acquired companies.. Our efforts to grow our business in emerging markets are subject to all of these risks plus additional, unique risks.  In certain markets, the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and could expose us to liabilities.. We also make investments in new business development initiatives which, like many startups, could have a relatively high failure rate.  We limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks, but losses could result and may be material.  Our growth strategy also may involve acquisitions, joint venture alliances and additional arrangements of distribution.  We may not be able to enter into acquisitions or joint venture arrangements on acceptable terms, and we may not successfully integrate these activities into our operations.  We also may not be successful in implementing new distribution channels, and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution.. When we introduce new products, we may incur expenses that we did not anticipate, such as recall expenses, resulting in reduced earnings.. The introduction of new products is critical to our future success.  We have additional costs when we introduce new products, such as initial labor or purchasing inefficiencies, but we may also incur unexpected expenses.  For example, we may experience unexpected engineering or design issues that will force a recall of a new product or increase production costs of the product above levels needed to ensure profitability.  In addition, we may make business decisions that include offering incentives to stimulate the sales of products not adequately accepted by the market, or to stimulate sales of older or less marketable products.  The costs resulting from these types of problems could be substantial and have a significant adverse effect on our earnings.. Any negative change in our relationship with our major customers could have significant adverse effects on revenues and profits.. Our financial success is directly related to the willingness of our customers to continue to purchase our products.  Failure to fill customers’ orders in a timely manner or on the terms and conditions they may impose could harm our relationships with our customers.  The importance of maintaining excellent relationships with our major customers may also give these customers leverage in our negotiations with them, including pricing and other supply terms, as well as post-sale disputes.  This leverage may lead to increased costs to us or decreased margins.  Furthermore, if any of our major customers experience a significant downturn in their business, or fail to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  There were no customers that accounted for 10 percent or greater of consolidated sales in 2017.. We depend on a small group of suppliers for some of our components, and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components at competitive prices, which would decrease our sales or earnings.. Most chassis, emergency response vehicle, aerial ladder and specialty vehicle commodity components are readily available from a variety of sources.  However, a few proprietary or specialty components are produced by a small group of suppliers.. In addition, we generally do not purchase chassis for our delivery vehicles.  Rather, we accept shipments of vehicle chassis owned by dealers or end-users for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing our specialized truck bodies on such chassis.  There are four primary sources for commercial chassis and we have established relationships with all major chassis manufacturers.. Changes in our relationships with these suppliers, shortages, production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture our products and secure sales.  If we cannot obtain an adequate supply of components or commercial chassis, this could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.. 14. Disruption of our supply base could affect our ability to obtain component parts.. We increasingly rely on component parts from global sources in order to manufacture our products.  Disruption of this supply base due to international political events or natural disasters could affect our ability to obtain component parts at acceptable prices, or at all, and have a negative impact on our sales, results of operations and financial position.. Changes to laws and regulations governing our business could have a material impact on our operations.. Our manufactured products and the industries in which we operate are subject to extensive federal and state regulations.  Changes to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the costs of manufacturing, purchasing, operating or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production, or cessation of operations.. Certain U.S. tax laws currently afford favorable tax treatment for the purchase and sale of recreational vehicles that are used as the equivalent of second homes.  These laws and regulations have historically been amended frequently, and it is likely that further amendments and additional regulations will be applicable to us and our products in the future. Amendments to these laws and regulations and the implementation of new regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental regulations relating to noise pollution and the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.  Although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental regulations, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, costly cleanup or capital expenditures.. Our businesses are cyclical and this can lead to fluctuations in our operating results.. The industries in which we operate are highly cyclical and there can be substantial fluctuations in our manufacturing, shipments and operating results, and the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.  Companies within these industries are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors such as economic, demographic and political changes.  Factors affecting the manufacture of chassis, emergency response vehicles, aerial ladders, specialty vehicles, delivery vehicles and other of our products include but are not limited to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCommodity prices; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFuel availability and prices. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tFederal, state and municipal budgets; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tUnemployment trends; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInternational tensions and hostilities; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic conditions; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVarious tax incentives; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tStrength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDealers’ and manufacturers’ inventory levels; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tInterest rates and the availability of financing.. Economic, legal and other factors could impact our customers’ ability to pay accounts receivable balances due from them.. In the ordinary course of business, customers are granted terms related to the sale of goods and services delivered to them.  These terms typically include a period of time between when the goods and services are tendered for delivery to the customer and when the customer needs to pay for these goods and services.  The amounts due under these payment terms are listed as accounts receivable on our balance sheet.  Prior to collection of these accounts receivable, our customers could encounter drops in sales, unexpected increases in expenses, or other factors which could impact their ability to continue as a going concern and which could affect the collectability of these amounts.  Writing off uncollectible accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow as the Company has major customers with material accounts receivable balances at any given time.. 15. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or experience a security breach. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, product engineering, manufacturing, accounting and other business processes.  While we believe we have robust processes in place to protect our information technology systems, if these systems are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to a cyber-security breach such as infection with viruses or intentional attacks aimed at theft or destruction of sensitive data, we may suffer an interruption in our ability to manage and operate the business, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.. Implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations.. We are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.  The ERP system was implemented at our first location in 2017, with the remaining locations expected to be implemented throughout 2018 to 2020.  This project requires significant investment of capital and human resources, the re-engineering of many processes of our business, and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business.  Should the system not be implemented successfully, we may incur impairment charges that could materially impact our financial results.  If the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner once implementation is complete, our business and operations could be disrupted and our results of operations negatively affected, including our ability to report accurate and timely financial results.. Global political conditions could have a negative effect on our business.. Concerns regarding acts of terrorism, armed conflicts, natural disasters and budget shortfalls have created significant global economic and political uncertainties that may have material and adverse effects on consumer demand (particularly the specialty and motor home markets), shipping and transportation, the availability of manufacturing components, commodity prices and our ability to engage in overseas markets.. Risks associated with international sales and contracts could have a negative effect on our business.. In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we derived 11.5%, 5.4% and 7.3% of our revenue from sales to, or related to, end customers outside the United States.  We expect that international sales will continue to account for a meaningful amount of our total revenue, especially in our emergency response vehicles segment.  Accordingly, we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance, including changes in foreign country regulatory requirements, the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies, import/export restrictions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and disruptions in the shipping of exported products.. Additionally, as a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations.. Fuel shortages, or higher prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on sales.. Gasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of the specialty vehicles we manufacture.  There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future.  Increases in gasoline and diesel prices and speculation about potential fuel shortages have had an unfavorable effect on consumer demand for motor homes from time to time in the past and may continue to do so in the future.  This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume.  Increases in the price of oil also can result in significant increases in the price of many of the components in our products, which may have an adverse impact on margins or sales volumes.. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.. Our quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including the timing and volume of orders, the completion of product inspections and acceptance by our customers, and various restructuring initiatives that may be undertaken from time to time.  In addition, our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment experiences seasonality whereby product shipments in the first and fourth quarters are generally lower than other quarters as a result of the busy holiday delivery operations experienced by some of its largest customers.  Accordingly, our financial results may be subject to significant and/or unanticipated quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.. 16. We could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.  At least annually, we review goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment.  Identifiable intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows.  In 2016 and 2015 we recorded asset impairment charges totaling $0.4 and $2.2 million against an asset group related to certain locations of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment.  If the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units fails to meet future forecasts, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could be required, under current U.S. accounting rules, to record additional impairment charges for our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets.  Any write-off of a material portion of such assets could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position.. Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which may result in losses to our shareholders.. The market price of the Company’s common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, quarterly fluctuations in operating results, a failure to meet published estimates of or changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, sales of common stock by existing holders, loss of key personnel, market conditions in our industries, shortages of key product inventory components and general economic conditions.. If there is a rise in the frequency and size of product liability, warranty and other claims against us, including wrongful death claims, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.. We are frequently subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation involving product liability and other claims, including wrongful death claims, related to personal injury and warranties.  We partially self-insure our product liability claims and purchase excess product liability insurance in the commercial insurance market.  We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us.  Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premiums that we are required to pay for such insurance to rise significantly.  It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, which may not be covered by our insurance.  In addition, a major product recall or increased levels of warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. In 2015 we entered into a settlement agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) pertaining to our early warning and defect reporting. The terms of the agreement include certain performance obligations that, if not completed satisfactorily, could subject us to additional fines of up to $5 million.. Increased costs, including costs of raw materials, component parts and labor costs, potentially impacted by changes in labor rates and practices, could reduce our operating income.. Our results of operations may be significantly affected by the availability and pricing of manufacturing components and labor, as well as changes in labor rates and practices.  Increases in costs of raw materials used in our products could affect the cost of our supply materials and components, as rising steel and aluminum prices have impacted the cost of certain of our manufacturing components.  Although we attempt to mitigate the effect of any escalation in components and labor costs by negotiating with current or new suppliers and by increasing productivity or, where necessary, by increasing the sales prices of our products, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so without it having an adverse impact on the competitiveness of our products and, therefore, our sales volume.  If we cannot successfully offset increases in our manufacturing costs, this could have a material adverse impact on our margins, operating income and cash flows.  Our profit margins may decrease if prices of purchased component parts or labor rates increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.  Even if we were able to offset higher manufacturing costs by increasing the sales prices of our products, the realization of any such increases often lags behind the rise in manufacturing costs, especially in our operations, due in part to our commitment to give our customers and dealers price protection with respect to previously placed customer orders."
