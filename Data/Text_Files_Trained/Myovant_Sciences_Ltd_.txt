[1] "Item 1A.                                                Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occurs, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be seriously harmed and the trading price of our common shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common shares. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\". Risks Related to Our Business, Financial Position and Capital Requirements. We have a limited operating history and no history of commercializing products, which may make it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We were formed in February 2016, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, raising capital, identifying and in-licensing our product candidates, including acquiring worldwide rights (excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries) to relugolix and worldwide rights to MVT-602, preparing for and advancing our product candidates into clinical development, conducting global clinical trials, and preparing for the potential commercialization of relugolix. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete a large-scale, pivotal clinical trial, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial scale product, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization.  We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown difficulties in achieving our business objectives.  If our product candidates are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we will need to expand our capabilities to support commercial activities and we may not be successful in adding such capabilities.  Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses for the foreseeable future; and we have not generated any revenue from any commercial products and may never achieve or maintain profitability.. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or fail to become commercially viable. Since inception, we have focused our efforts on research and development with the goal of achieving regulatory approval and have incurred significant operating losses.  Our net loss was $143.3 million and $83.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $1.7 million for the period from February 2, 2016 (Date of Inception) to March 31, 2016, and, as of March 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $228.5 million.. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses over the next several years as we continue to develop relugolix and MVT-602. Past operating losses, combined with expected future operating losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and working capital.  If we obtain regulatory approval for relugolix or MVT-602, we expect to incur increased sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses.  As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future.. Neither relugolix nor MVT-602 has been approved for marketing anywhere in the world, and they may never receive such approval. As a result, we have never generated any product revenue. We are uncertain when or if we will achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of relugolix and MVT-602, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, and have relugolix and MVT-602 manufactured and successfully marketed. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize relugolix or MVT-602. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market relugolix or MVT-602, our revenue will be dependent upon, in part and among other things, the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the number of competitors in such markets, the accepted price for relugolix and MVT-602 and whether we own the commercial rights for those territories. If the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of relugolix or MVT-602, even if approved. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common shares and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.. 26. Table of Contents. We are heavily dependent on the success of relugolix and MVT-602, our only product candidates, which are still under clinical development, and if either relugolix or MVT-602 does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business may be harmed.. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with no products approved for commercial sale. We have invested and expect to continue to invest a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures in the development and advancement of our product candidates, relugolix and MVT-602.  Our business and our ability to generate revenue depends heavily on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of these product candidates, which may never occur. We currently generate no revenues from sales of any product.  We may never receive regulatory approval for any indication for relugolix or MVT-602 and may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.  The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of products are and will remain subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries. We are not permitted to market relugolix or MVT-602 in the U.S. until we receive approval of New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or in any foreign country until we receive the requisite approvals from the appropriate regulatory authorities in such countries.. Obtaining approval of an NDA or similar regulatory approval is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain process, and the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority may delay, limit or deny approval of relugolix or MVT-602.  See the Risk Factor titled \"The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable, and even if we obtain approval for a product candidate in one country or jurisdiction, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize it in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.\"  We have not submitted an NDA to the FDA, or any comparable application to any other regulatory authority.. Even if we receive regulatory approval for relugolix or MVT-602, our ability to generate revenues from relugolix or MVT-602 will depend on our ability to:. • set an acceptable price for relugolix or MVT-602 and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for third-party payors;. • establish effective sales, marketing, and distribution systems in jurisdictions around the world for relugolix (excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries) or MVT-602;. • initiate and continue relationships with Takeda and/or other third-party manufacturers and have commercial quantities of relugolix or MVT-602 manufactured at acceptable cost and quality levels;. • attract and retain experienced management and advisory teams;. • achieve broad market acceptance of our products in the medical community and with third-party payors and consumers;. • launch commercial sales of our products, whether alone or in collaboration with others;. • establish the safety and efficacy of relugolix and MVT-602 in comparison to competing products; and. • maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio.. If we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment in us may be adversely affected.. If we are unable to formulate a fixed-dose combination version of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin for women's health indications, its potential commercial opportunity and competitive advantage could be limited.. Relugolix may cause reversible loss of bone mineral density due to the hypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix that may limit duration of use. This risk, and a related risk of hot flush, are mitigated by the co-administration of low-dose estradiol and progestin as hormonal add-back therapy. A key part of our relugolix clinical development strategy is to formulate a fixed-dose combination of relugolix with low-dose estradiol and progestin add-back therapy to facilitate patient convenience and compliance. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to formulate a fixed-dose combination in time for the initial application for market authorization, we expect to seek approval for relugolix tablets co-packaged with commercially available low-dose estradiol and progestin. This would potentially decrease our advantages relative to our competition by requiring patients to take two pills once daily instead of one pill once daily until the fixed-dose combination could be developed. If our competitors develop a fixed-dose combination with hormonal add-back therapy before we do, or if we are unable to do so, then we would be at a competitive disadvantage and this could limit our commercial opportunity. We are not aware of any barriers preventing competitors from developing or achieving regulatory approval of a fixed-dose combination.. 27. Table of Contents. We are conducting our Phase 3 clinical trials of relugolix in our target women's health indications with co-administration of relugolix and commercially available low-dose estradiol and progestin products. We intend to conduct bridging studies to support the submission of NDAs or comparable applications for the proposed fixed-dose combination for each of our target women's health indications. Any such bridging study may be unsuccessful or insufficient to support approval of the fixed-dose combination formulation, which would delay and increase the expenses associated with our development program and could limit our commercial opportunity.. The terms of the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the Hercules Loan Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.. In October 2017, we and our subsidiaries entered into the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the Hercules Loan Agreement. Our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement are secured by a second lien security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets, other than intellectual property, and our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement are secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' respective assets, other than intellectual property.. Each of these agreements includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants and representations and warranties, including a minimum cash covenant. Under the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement, a minimum cash covenant applies commencing on November 1, 2020 (or November 1, 2021 if extended pursuant to the terms of the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement) and under the Hercules Loan Agreement, a minimum cash covenant applies until such time as the Company achieves certain clinical development and financing milestones as set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement. Other restrictive covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness, liens (including a negative pledge on intellectual property and other assets), investments, distributions (including dividends), transfers, mergers or acquisitions, taxes, corporate changes and deposit accounts. Compliance with these covenants may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to take actions that might be advantageous to us and our shareholders.. Additionally, the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the Hercules Loan Agreement each also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, cross acceleration to certain debt, certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency and certain events relating to United Kingdom or Irish pension plans. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% will apply to the \"Secured Obligations\" as defined in the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement, and NovaQuest, as the agent for the holders of the notes, may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Hercules Loan Agreement, a default interest rate of an additional 5.0% may be applied to the outstanding principal balance, and Hercules may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Hercules Loan Agreement. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, our obligations under the notes issued pursuant to the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and our obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement would automatically become due and payable. We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay these outstanding obligations at the time any event of default occurs. In that case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our clinical development efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. NovaQuest and Hercules could also exercise their rights to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing our obligations, which collateral includes all of our and our subsidiaries' respective assets other than intellectual property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed as a result of any of these events.. We may not be successful in our efforts to identify and acquire or in-license additional product candidates.. Part of our strategy involves identifying and acquiring or in-licensing novel product candidates. The process by which we identify product candidates may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including those discussed in these risk factors and also:. • the process by which we identify and decide to acquire product candidates may not be successful;. • potential product candidates may, upon further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance; or. • potential product candidates may not be effective in treating their targeted diseases.. We may choose to focus our efforts and resources on a potential product candidate that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful. Further, time and resources spent searching for, identifying, acquiring, and developing potential product candidates may distract management's attention from our primary business or other development programs. If we are unable to identify and acquire suitable product candidates for clinical development, this would adversely impact our business strategy, our financial position, and common share price.. 28. Table of Contents. We will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of relugolix or MVT-602.. We expect to spend substantial amounts to complete the development of, seek regulatory approvals for and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602. These expenditures will include costs associated with the Takeda License Agreement, pursuant to which we are obligated to cover substantial development costs of relugolix and MVT-602 and make royalty payments in connection with the net sales of resulting products, if any.. We will require additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful development of relugolix and MVT-602 are highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate with certainty the actual capital we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Under the terms of the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the NovaQuest Equity Purchase Agreement, failure of relugolix clinical trials would negatively impact our ability to obtain the remaining financing currently available to us. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:. • the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of our planned and ongoing clinical trials for relugolix and MVT-602;. • the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;. • the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;. • the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or our products or any future product candidates;. • the effect of competing technological and market developments;. • the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;. • the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our products in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own; and. • the initiation, progress, timing and results of our commercialization of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale.. We believe that our existing cash, together with the remaining financing commitments of $92.0 million available to us from NovaQuest will be sufficient for us to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. This estimate is based on our current assumptions, including assumptions relating to our ability to manage our spend, that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We cannot be certain that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates or potentially discontinue operations. In addition, attempting to secure additional capital may divert the time and attention of our management from day-to-day activities and harm our product candidate development efforts. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays, operating expenditures and capital requirements associated with our current and anticipated product development programs.. Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities may cause dilution to existing shareholders, raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants, and raising funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic alliances, and license and development agreements or other collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders' ownership may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of a common shareholder.  Our existing agreements with NovaQuest and Hercules involve, and any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.. 29. Table of Contents. We rely on agreements with Takeda to provide rights to the core intellectual property relating to our existing product candidates and to supply us with clinical trial material to support development of relugolix and MVT-602. Any termination or loss of significant rights under those agreements would adversely affect our development or commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602.. We have licensed our core intellectual property relating to relugolix and MVT-602 from Takeda. If, for any reason, the Takeda License Agreement is terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it would adversely affect our business. The Takeda License Agreement imposes on us obligations relating to exclusivity, territorial rights, development, commercialization, funding, payment, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, intellectual property protection, and other matters. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages to Takeda and Takeda may have the right to terminate our license, which would result in us being unable to develop, manufacture, and sell relugolix and MVT-602.. In June 2016, we and one of Takeda's affiliates, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda Limited, entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix.  Under this agreement, Takeda Limited will supply us, and we will obtain from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product to be used under our development plans for all indications.  If we request, Takeda Limited will assist us with a technical transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix to us or our designee and we will pay the expenses related to such transfer.  On May 30, 2018, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Takeda will manufacture and supply us with relugolix drug substance to support the commercial launch of relugolix, if marketing authorization is granted.  Takeda has agreed to assist with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of our subsidiary, Myovant Sciences GmbH.  We will pay the expenses related to such transfers.  If Takeda fails to fulfill its obligations to manufacture and supply clinical and/or commercial quantities of relugolix to us or to enable the transfer of the manufacturing process for relugolix to us or our designee, our development plans and commercialization of relugolix, if approved, could be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected.. We currently have a limited number of employees who are employed by our wholly owned subsidiaries and we rely on Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH to provide various services for us.. As of March 31, 2018, we had 86 employees.  To operate our business, we rely in part on services provided by RSI and RSG, wholly owned subsidiaries of RSL, pursuant to the RSI Services Agreement and the RSG Services Agreement, as described under Part I. Item 1. \"Business - Our Key Agreements - Services Agreements with Roivant Sciences, Inc. and Roivant Sciences GmbH.\" Personnel and support staff who provide services to us under these Services Agreements are not required to treat management and administration of our business as their primary responsibility or act exclusively for us, and we do not expect them to do so. Under the Services Agreements, RSI and RSG have the discretion to determine who, among their employees, will perform services for us.. If either RSI or RSG fails to perform its obligations in accordance with the terms of the Services Agreements or to effectively manage services provided to us, the operations of our business may be adversely affected. If either the RSI Services Agreement or the RSG Services Agreement is terminated for any reason, we may be unable to contract with substitute service providers on similar terms, in a timely fashion or at all, and the costs of substituting service providers may be substantial. In addition, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of services to us due to lack of pre-existing knowledge or synergies. In that case, the operations of our business would be adversely affected.. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.. We expect to hire additional employees for our managerial team and other teams supporting G&A, operations and many other functions.  Many of the other pharmaceutical companies we currently compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer operating history in the industry than we do.  They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances of career advancement.  Some of these opportunities may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer.  Due to these reasons, we may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel.. 30. Table of Contents. In addition, our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our management team and key employees. Our senior management and key employees may terminate their positions with us at any time.  In addition, we do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or other employees.  If we lose one or more members of our senior management team or key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies could be seriously harmed. Replacing these individuals may be difficult, cause disruption, and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize products successfully. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital, our ability to commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 if we obtain regulatory approvals, and our ability to implement our business strategies.. We plan to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.. We expect to expand our organization and hire additional employees.  Our management is expected to have increasing responsibilities to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate, and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors which may divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities. The expected growth may also require significant capital expenditures and divert financial resources from other projects.  If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or grow revenue could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. As a result, our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize relugolix, MVT-602 or any potential future product candidate may be adversely affected.. Our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers, and other vendors, or those of our affiliates, may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. We are exposed to the risk that our employees and contractors, including principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers, and other vendors, or those of our affiliates, may engage in fraudulent, illegal activity, or other misconduct. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA or other regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete, and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing and cGMP standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws and regulations that require the true, complete, and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, bribery, corruption, antitrust violations, and other abusive practices. See the Risk Factors titled \"Our current and future relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties,\" \"International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.,\" and \"If we obtain approval to commercialize any products outside of the U.S., a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\"  These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our nonclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate compliance policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government agency could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers or other vendors, or those of our affiliates, are found to be in violation of any such regulatory standards or requirements, it could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, suspension or delay in our clinical trials, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, FDA debarment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.. 31. Table of Contents. International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.. Part of our business strategy involves international expansion, including establishing and maintaining operations outside of the U.S. and establishing and maintaining relationships with health care providers, payors, government officials, distributors and manufacturers globally. Conducting business internationally involves a number of risks, including:. • multiple conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;. • possible failure by us or our distributors to obtain appropriate licenses or regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our product candidates, if approved, in various countries;. • difficulties in managing foreign operations;. • complexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;. • financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;. • reduced protection for intellectual property rights;. • business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, economic instability, or natural disasters, including, but not limited to, wars and terrorism, political unrest, outbreak of disease, earthquakes, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions;. • failure to comply with foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, security and transfer of personal data, including the European Union General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR, which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data of individuals within the European Union; and. • failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions, for example by failing to maintain accurate information and control over sales or distributors' activities.. Also, see the Risk Factor titled \"International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.\" Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Our internal computer systems, as well as those of RSI and RSG, and our third-party collaborators, consultants or contractors, may fail or suffer cybersecurity breaches and data leakage, which could result in a material disruption of our business and operations.. Our computer systems, as well as those of RSI, RSG and our Contract Research Organizations, or CROs, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and other contractors, consultants, and law and accounting firms, may sustain damage or data leakage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, data breaches, cybercriminals, natural disasters (including hurricanes and earthquakes), terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by our workforce, others with authorized access to our information systems or unauthorized persons could cause interruptions in our operations and result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of nonclinical or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of relugolix or MVT-602 or any future product candidate could be delayed.. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our or our third-party providers' systems, portable media or storage devises. We could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our information system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent services interruptions or security breaches.. 32. Table of Contents. If we fail to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulation, we may be subject to liabilities that adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance.. Our information security systems are subject to laws and regulations requiring that we take measures to protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business.  For example, HIPAA, and its implementing regulations impose, among other requirements, certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy and security of personal health information.  In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws, including, without limitation, state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and storage of personal information.. We may also be subject to or affected by foreign laws and regulation, including regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, security, transfer and storage of personal data, such as information that we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials and our other operations in the U.S. and abroad.  The global legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.  This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability or impose additional costs on us.  The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future.  For example, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data.  The GDPR is likely to increase compliance burden on us, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and leverage information about them.  The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators.  In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue.  While companies are afforded some flexibility in determining how to comply with the GDPR's various requirements, it has and will continue to require significant effort and expense to ensure continuing compliance with the GDPR.  Moreover, the requirements under the GDPR may change periodically or may be modified by European Union national law, and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements.  It is possible that each of these privacy laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.  In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising.  As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.. Use of social media platforms presents new risks.. We believe that our targeted patient population is active on social media.  Social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business.  For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a product candidate, which could result in reporting obligations.  In addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or our product candidates on any social networking website.  If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.. The failure to successfully implement an enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and results of operations.. RSI and RSG commenced the implementation of a company-wide enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to upgrade certain existing business, operational, and financial processes, upon which we rely. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that require transformations of business and finance processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system; any such transformation involves risk inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to normal operations. Additionally, if the ERP system is not effectively implemented as planned, or the system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed. Significant delays in documenting, reviewing and testing our internal control over financial reporting could cause us to fail to comply with our U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reporting obligations related to our management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we experience interruptions in service or operational difficulties and are unable to effectively manage our business during or following the implementation of the ERP system, our business and results of operations could be harmed.. 33. Table of Contents. Potential product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could impact ongoing and planned clinical trials as well as limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.. The use of relugolix and MVT-602 in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, other pharmaceutical companies or others taking or otherwise coming into contact with our products. On occasion, large monetary judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits where drugs have had unanticipated adverse effects. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:. • impairment of our business reputation and significant negative media attention;. • withdrawal of participants from our clinical trials;. • significant costs to defend related litigation;. • distraction of management's attention from our primary business;. • substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;. • inability to commercialize our products or any future product candidates;. • product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;. • decreased demand for our products or any future product candidate, if approved for commercial sale; and. • loss of revenue.. The product liability and clinical trial insurance we currently carry, and any additional product liability and clinical trial insurance coverage we acquire in the future, may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for relugolix or MVT-602, we intend to acquire insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our common share price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business, including preventing or limiting the commercialization of any product candidates we develop.. 34. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Clinical Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization. Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes.. Our product candidates, relugolix and MVT-602, are still in development and will require extensive clinical testing before we are prepared to submit an NDA or other similar application for regulatory approval. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit an NDA for regulatory approval for relugolix or MVT-602 in any indication or whether any such application will be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities. Human clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed analysis plans for any clinical trials of relugolix or MVT-602, which may delay the approval of an NDA or similar application. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming.. Failures can occur at any stage of clinical trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. In addition, results from clinical trials may require further evaluation, delaying the next stage of clinical development or submission of an NDA. Further, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. For example, Takeda's Phase 2 trial for relugolix in men with advanced prostate cancer, C27002, did not meet the criteria for success for its primary endpoint specified in the statistical analysis plan, highlighting the importance of appropriate selection of the primary endpoint, statistical powering of a clinical study, and diligent oversight of the treatment compliance of those patients enrolled into the trial. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in or the discontinuation of advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Likewise, the results of early clinical trials of relugolix and MVT-602 may not be predictive of the results of our planned development programs, and there can be no assurance that the results of studies conducted by collaborators or other third parties will be viewed favorably or are indicative of our own future study results.. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:. • failure to obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial;. • unforeseen safety issues;. • lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;. • identification of dosing issues;. • inability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;. • slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment or failure to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;. • failure to open a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;. • unanticipated impact from changes in or modifications to clinical trial design;. • inability or unwillingness of clinical investigators or study participants to follow our clinical and other applicable protocols;. • premature discontinuation of study participants from clinical trials or missing data;. • failure to manufacture or release sufficient quantities of relugolix, MVT-602, estradiol, progestin or placebo or failure to obtain sufficient quantities of concomitant medication, that in each case meet our quality standards, for use in clinical trials;. • inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; or. • inappropriate unblinding of study results.. 35. Table of Contents. Further, we, the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, or other regulatory authority may suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we or our collaborators are failing to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including, the FDA's current Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, or Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, regulations, that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks, or if the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, finds deficiencies in our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, or other submissions or the manner in which the clinical trials are conducted. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement or completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of relugolix or MVT-602 could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from relugolix or MVT-602 may be delayed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, cause a decline in our common share price, slow down the approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.. Moreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected the integrity of the study. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.. In addition, prior to our acquisition of worldwide rights (excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries) to relugolix and worldwide rights to MVT-602, we had no involvement with or control over the nonclinical or clinical development of either relugolix or MVT-602. We are dependent on Takeda having conducted such research & development in accordance with the applicable protocols, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, having accurately reported the results of all clinical trials and other research conducted prior to our acquisition of the rights to relugolix and MVT-602, having correctly collected and interpreted the data from these trials and other research, and having supplied us with complete information, data sets, and reports required to adequately demonstrate the results reported through the date of our acquisition of these assets. Problems related to predecessors could result in increased costs and delays in the development of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our ability to generate any future revenue from these product candidates.. The results of our clinical trials may not support our proposed claims for relugolix or MVT-602.. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support the efficacy or safety of relugolix or MVT-602. Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and nonclinical testing. Likewise, promising results in interim analyses or other preliminary analyses do not ensure that the clinical trial as a whole will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier nonclinical or clinical studies. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical studies were underway and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical studies, including previously unreported adverse events. The results of nonclinical and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage nonclinical studies or clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical and initial clinical trials. A future failure of a clinical trial to meet its predetermined endpoints would likely cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of any other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of our NDAs to the FDA or other similar applications with other relevant foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize relugolix and MVT-602 and generate product revenue.. Reported data or other clinical development announcements by Takeda may adversely affect our clinical development plan.. Takeda is developing relugolix for the treatment of women with uterine fibroid-associated pain and heavy menstrual bleeding in Japan. Takeda reported positive top-line results from its two Phase 3 clinical trials in Japan in women with uterine fibroids and announced that it had submitted the data from both of these trials to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan for marketing authorization of relugolix in Japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids.  Favorable announcements by Takeda regarding these trials do not guarantee that the results of our clinical trials will also be favorable as the designs of our Phase 3 clinical trials differ from those of Takeda. Further, if subsequent announcements by Takeda regarding its development of relugolix are unfavorable, it could negatively impact our clinical development plans for relugolix.. 36. Table of Contents. Recruitment, enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.. We may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials on our current timelines, or at all, and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials. Enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipated, leading to delays in our development timelines. Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study and the proportion of patients screened that meets those criteria, our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, and the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion. Furthermore, any negative results we or Takeda may report in clinical trials of our product candidate may make it difficult or impossible to recruit, enroll, and retain patients in other clinical trials of that same product candidate. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their drug candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment, enrollment,  or retention in our clinical trials. Also, marketing authorization of competitors in the same class of product candidates may impair our ability to recruit, enroll, or retain patients into our clinical trials, delaying or potentially preventing us from completing clinical trials. Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop relugolix and MVT-602, or could render further development impossible.. We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.. Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. As a significant unmet medical need exists for the treatment of each of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and advanced prostate cancer, as well as infertility in women, there are several large and small pharmaceutical companies focused on delivering therapeutics for the treatment of these indications. Further, it is likely that additional drugs will become available in the future for the treatment of each of our target indications.. We are aware of several companies that are developing drugs that would compete against relugolix for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, endometriosis-associated pain, and/or advanced prostate cancer and against MVT-602 for the treatment of female infertility as part of assisted reproduction. Additional information regarding our competition is included in Part I. Item 1. \"Business  -  Competition.\"  Many of our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us to participate in clinical trials, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors.. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, drugs that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop.. We will face competition from other drugs currently approved or that will be approved in the future for the treatment of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and advanced prostate cancer, as well as infertility in females. Therefore, our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:. • develop and commercialize medicines that are superior in safety and efficacy to other products in the market;. • demonstrate through our clinical trials that relugolix or MVT-602 are differentiated from existing and future therapies;. • attract qualified scientific, product development, and commercial personnel;. • obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our medicines;. • obtain required regulatory approvals;. • obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from, and negotiate competitive pricing with, third-party payors; and. • successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development, and commercialization of new medicines.. The availability of our competitors' products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for any product candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drugs would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.. 37. Table of Contents. Established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make relugolix or MVT-602 less competitive. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, discovering, developing, receiving FDA or other regulatory authority approval for or commercializing medicines before we do, which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.. If we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize relugolix or MVT-602, and our ability to generate product revenue will be materially impaired.. Relugolix and MVT-602 and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and by similar regulatory authorities outside the U.S. Failure to obtain marketing approval for relugolix and MVT-602 will prevent us from commercializing them.. We have not received approval from regulatory authorities to market any product candidate in any jurisdiction, and it is possible that neither relugolix, MVT-602 nor any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence product sales. Neither we nor Takeda, nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S.. The time required to obtain approval of an NDA by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authority. Prior to submitting an NDA to the FDA or any comparable application to any other foreign regulatory authorities for approval of relugolix, we will need to complete our ongoing Phase 3 programs for relugolix, and for approval of MVT-602, we will need to complete Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions.. Securing marketing approvals requires the submission of extensive nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the safety and efficacy of relugolix and MVT-602 for the specified indication. Further, because we are exploring the use of relugolix co-administered with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy as a longer-term therapy (i.e., greater than 6 months) for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain, we expect to be required to submit data on a patient population followed for at least one year. We expect to rely on third-party CROs and consultants to assist us in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Delays or errors in the submission of applications for marketing approval or issues, including those related to gathering the appropriate data and the inspection process, may ultimately delay or affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval, commercialize our product candidates, and generate product revenue.. Relugolix and MVT-602 may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.. Adverse events associated with relugolix or MVT-602 could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. If an unacceptable frequency or severity of adverse events are reported in our clinical trials for relugolix or MVT-602 or any future product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates may be negatively impacted. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects.. Furthermore, concern has been raised by the FDA about a potential increase in the risk of diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases in men with prostate cancer treated with GnRH agonists.  On May 18, 2018 the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, or PRAC, completed its review of Esmya (ulipristal acetate) following reports of serious liver injury.  The PRAC concluded that Esmya may have contributed to the development of some cases of serious liver injury.  The PRAC has recommended that Esmya must not be used in women with known liver problems and should be used for more than one treatment course only in women who are not eligible for surgery.  Liver function testing should be performed at the start of each treatment course and once a month and for two to four weeks after stopping treatment for the first two treatment courses.   Although a different class of drugs, the review of post-marketing events of liver toxicity for Esmya by the PRAC, may lead to increased scrutiny regarding liver function for GnRH antagonists.  For example, the FDA has extended the PDUFA date for elagolix in endometriosis, requesting additional information on patients with abnormal liver function.. 38. Table of Contents. If any of our product candidates are approved and then cause serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:. • regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or a REMS (or equivalent outside the U.S.) to impose restrictions on its distribution or other risk management measures;. • we may be required to recall a product;. • additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product or any component thereof;. • regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;. • we may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical trials;. • we may be required to repeat a nonclinical study or clinical trial or terminate a program, even if other studies or trials related to the program are ongoing or have been successfully completed;. • we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;. • we could elect to discontinue the sale of our product;. • the product may become less competitive; and. • our reputation may suffer.. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing relugolix or MVT-602.. The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable, and even if we obtain approval for a product candidate in one country or jurisdiction, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize it in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in any jurisdiction, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA in the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other country or jurisdiction. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized.. 39. Table of Contents. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.. Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, recordkeeping, export, import, advertising, and promotional activities for such product, among other things, will be subject to extensive and ongoing requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment of registration and drug listing requirements, continued compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of drug product samples to physicians, recordkeeping, and current GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions - including in some cases, a boxed warning - be included in the product labeling. If relugolix or MVT-602 receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit sales of the product.. Regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the U.S., and other comparable regulations in foreign jurisdictions, relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to enforcement actions and investigations by the FDA, Department of Justice, State Attorney Generals and other foreign regulatory agencies alleging violations of U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws and comparable laws in foreign jurisdictions.. In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results, including:. • restrictions on the manufacture of such products;. • restrictions on the labeling or marketing of such products;. • restrictions on product distribution or use;. • requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;. • requirement of a REMS (or equivalent outside the U.S.);. • Warning or Untitled Letters;. • withdrawal of the products from the market;. • recall of products;. • fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;. • suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;. • refusal to permit the import or export of such products;. • product seizure; or. • injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.. The FDA and other regulatory authorities' policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of relugolix or MVT-602 or any future product candidate. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or to the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained.. 40. Table of Contents. Even if one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.. Even if one of our product candidates receives marketing approval, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. If it does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue or become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of a product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:. • the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;. • the prevalence and severity of any side effects;. • the content of the approved product label;. • the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;. • the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;. • our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;. • the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;. • the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;. • the strength of marketing and distribution support;. • the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement; and. • any restrictions on the use of our product together with other medications.. Because we expect sales of relugolix and MVT-602, if approved, to generate substantially all of our product revenue for the foreseeable future, the failure of these product candidates to obtain market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing.. If we are unable to establish sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, if approved.. We are currently building our sales and marketing infrastructure; however, we currently do not have an established infrastructure for the sales, marketing, or distribution of our products, and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any product that may be approved, we must build our sales, distribution, marketing, managerial, and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need a sales and marketing organization.. We expect to build a focused sales, distribution, and marketing infrastructure to market our product candidates in the U.S., if approved. There are significant expenses and risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, including our ability to hire, retain, and appropriately incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities could delay any product launch, which would adversely impact its commercialization. For example, if the commercial launch of relugolix or MVT-602, if approved, for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:. • our inability to recruit, train, and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;. • the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or attain adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any drugs;. • the inability to negotiate with payors regarding reimbursement for our products; and. • unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.. 41. Table of Contents. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our product candidates in certain markets overseas. Therefore, our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborator's strategic interest in our products, and such collaborator's ability to successfully market and sell the products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our product candidates, if approved, for certain markets overseas; however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.. If we are unable to build our own sales force or negotiate a collaborative relationship for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may be forced to delay their potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities for them. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market or generate product revenue. We could enter into arrangements with collaborative partners at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required to relinquish certain rights to our product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects.. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates and may not become profitable. We will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.. If we obtain approval to market any products outside of the U.S., a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.. If either relugolix or MVT-602 is approved for marketing outside of the U.S., we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market these products in certain jurisdictions. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to international operations or entering into international business relationships, including:. • different regulatory requirements for drug approvals and rules governing drug commercialization in foreign countries;. • reduced or no protection of intellectual property rights;. • unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;. • economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;. • compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;. • foreign reimbursement, pricing, and insurance regimes;. • foreign taxes;. • foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;. • workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;. • potential noncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, or similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions as well as various regulations pertaining to data privacy, such as the GDPR;. • production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and. • business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires.. Also, see the Risk Factor titled \"International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial, economic, and other risks associated with conducting business outside of the U.S.\" We have no prior experience in these countries, and many biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their products in foreign countries to be very challenging.. 42. Table of Contents. Our current and future relationships with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, and customers will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties.. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient support, charitable organizations and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws regulate the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell, and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, among others:. • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;. • the federal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which imposes criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly making or causing to be made, a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; in addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;. • the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false or fraudulent statements relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;. • HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which also impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information on health plans, health care clearing houses, and most providers and their business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity;. • a number of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidance and standards that impose requirements regarding the protection of health or other personal data that are applicable to or affect our operations;. • the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \"transfers of value\" made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members and payments or other \"transfers of value\" to such physician owners (covered manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year); and. • analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state antikickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales, and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.. 43. Table of Contents. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits, and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even the mere issuance of a subpoena or the fact of an investigation alone, regardless of the merit, may result in negative publicity, a drop in our share price, and other harm to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time- consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.. Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize relugolix or MVT-602 and affect the prices we may obtain.. In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of relugolix or MVT-602, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any products for which we obtain marketing approval.. For example, in the U.S. in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the healthcare industry, and impose additional healthcare policy reforms. The law has continued the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and increased the industry's regulatory burdens and operating costs.. The financial impact of the ACA over the next few years will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for products affected by the new system of rebates, discounts and fees.. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA.  Since January 2017, the President has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA.  Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage.  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, the President signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated under the ACA.. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted.  These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional action is taken by Congress.  In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period in which the government may recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.. Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products.  Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.  Additionally, on May 11, 2018, President Trump laid out his administration's \"Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs\" to reduce the cost of prescription drugs while preserving innovation and cures.  Although some of these and other proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.  For more information about healthcare reform, please see Part I. Item 1. \"Business  - Government Regulation  -  Healthcare Reform.\". 44. Table of Contents. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.. Legislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.  We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be.  In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA's approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell them profitably, if approved.. Market acceptance and sales of any approved product that we develop will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health insurers. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop through approval will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Additionally, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the drug, on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed, and whether to require step therapy. The position of a drug on a formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products.. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Even if we do obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, products. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.. Additionally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the U.S. and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any future drugs profitably. These legislative and regulatory changes may negatively impact the reimbursement for any future drugs, if approved.. 45. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties. We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and will rely on Takeda and its affiliates and other third parties to produce clinical and commercial supplies of relugolix and MVT-602 and any future product candidate.. We do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. While relugolix and MVT-602 were being developed by Takeda, they were also being manufactured by Takeda and third-party contract manufacturing organizations. Takeda has retained rights to further develop and commercialize relugolix in Japan and certain other Asian countries, and Takeda is continuing to develop relugolix in Japan. In April 2016, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to MVT-602 for all human diseases and conditions. Takeda is no longer developing this compound. We expect that manufacturing support provided by Takeda will be sufficient for us to complete our ongoing Phase 3 programs for relugolix. We expect that the MVT-602 drug substance transferred from Takeda to us under the terms of the Takeda License Agreement will be sufficient for our near-term development plans. However, additional process development and manufacturing would be required in order for us to complete Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies for MVT-602. The drug substance transferred from Takeda may not meet our quality standards and may be disqualified from use in our planned clinical programs. Third-party vendors may be difficult to identify for MVT-602 process and formulation development and manufacturing due to special capabilities required and they may not be able to meet our quality standards. Further, we are dependent on third parties to help formulate and manufacture a fixed-dose combination of relugolix and low-dose estradiol and progestin. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing, and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our product candidates.. Both relugolix and MVT-602 are potent hormonal therapies and therefore require specialized manufacturing facilities. Depending on actual commercial demand, additional third-party manufacturing facilities will have to be established to meet the demand through technology transfer, process validation and regulatory approval before product manufactured at the new facilities can be marketed. Any delay in the technology transfer and process validation could limit adequate supply to meet our commercial demand.. We also will rely on Takeda or other third-party manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of relugolix and MVT-602 to be used, if approved, for the commercialization of each. The facilities used by Takeda and our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Further, our reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including:. • delay or inability to develop a fixed-dose combination product of relugolix and low-dose estradiol and progestin;. • failure of the drug substance transferred from Takeda to meet our product specifications and quality requirements;. • inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;. • delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;. • manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;. • costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;. • failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, including GMP and similar foreign standards;. • deficient or improper record-keeping;. • inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;. • termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;. 46. Table of Contents. • reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell relugolix, a fixed-dose combination product or co-packaging of relugolix and low-dose estradiol and progestin, or MVT-602, if approved, or any future product candidate in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;. • lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;. • operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or other regulatory sanctions related to the manufacture of another company's products;. • carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and. • failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.. Any of these events could lead to clinical trial delays, cost overruns, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products, as well as potential product liability litigation, product recalls or product withdrawals. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory authority action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.. Manufacturing problems, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, could cause inventory shortages and delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our business operations.. In order to sustain our business, we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates to satisfy our clinical trial needs and any approved products to satisfy demand.  Our product candidates and products, if approved, are a result of  complex manufacturing processes.  The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations.. Our product candidates are currently manufactured by third-party manufacturers or corporate partners and we expect that any future product candidates as well as any products, if approved, will be manufactured by third-party manufacturers or corporate partners.  We depend on these third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis.. Our third party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control.  If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval, as well as meet demand for any approved products.  We utilized a limited number of third-party manufacturers and corporate partners and may not be able to locate additional or replacement facilities on a reasonable basis, or at all.. Pharmaceutical manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies.  If we or our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are unable to remedy any deficiencies cited by FDA in its inspections, our ability to deliver product candidates to clinical trial sites on a timely basis, the timing of any potential regulatory approvals of products in development, and our ability to deliver commercial product for any approved products, could be negatively impacted.  To the extent that any of these risks materialize, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.. We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell any of our product candidates, if approved.. We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture commercial inventories of our product candidates, if approved.  If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture commercial products would be limited.. 47. Table of Contents. Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in the new drug application or marketing authorization application filed with the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval, and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required.  Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP.  Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the regulatory authorities following initial approval.  If, as a result of these inspections, a regulatory authority determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any single suppliers for any of our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet demand, which could harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship commercial products that may be approved for marketing or supply our products in development for clinical trials.  In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made only at one facility, which we may not be able to replace in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.  Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on, including in the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure, or other difficulty, may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.. If we were to encounter any of these difficulties, our ability to provide our products, if approved, and product candidates to patients would be jeopardized.. We are reliant on third parties to conduct, supervise, and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.. We currently do not have the ability to independently conduct nonclinical studies that comply with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements. We also do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. We rely exclusively on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we have limited influence over their actual performance.. We rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our clinical programs, as well as for the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CROs' activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.. We and our CROs are required to comply with current GLP and GCP regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and are also required by the competent authorities of the member states of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to comply with the International Council for Harmonization guidelines for any of our product candidates that are in nonclinical and clinical development, respectively. The regulatory authorities enforce GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and clinical trial sites. Although we rely on CROs to conduct our GLP-compliant nonclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our GLP nonclinical studies and GCP clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we or our CROs fail to comply with current GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may reject our marketing applications or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Accordingly, if we or our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or other applicable laws, regulations or standards, or fail to recruit a sufficient number of subjects, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the relevant regulatory approval process. Failure by our CROs to properly execute study protocols in accordance with applicable law could also create product liability and healthcare regulatory risks for us as sponsors of those studies.. While we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs are not our employees, and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities which could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may reduce our trade secret and intellectual property protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our (or their own) clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop could be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.. 48. Table of Contents. In addition, we and our CROs are subject to various data privacy laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere that are often uncertain, contradictory, and evolving. It is possible that these data privacy laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistent with our or our CROs practices.  If so, this could result in government imposed fines or orders requiring that we or our CROs change our practices, which could adversely affect our business.. If our relationships with these CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Switching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.. 49. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our drug development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to relugolix, MVT-602, and any future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our development programs and product candidates. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.. The patents and patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that protect relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate in the U.S. or in other foreign countries. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application, or be used to invalidate a patent. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates or companion diagnostic that we may develop. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate under patent protection could be reduced.. If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop product candidates, and threaten our ability to commercialize future drugs. Any such outcome could have a materially adverse effect on our business.. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been and will continue to be the subject of litigation and new legislation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. For example, many countries restrict the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body. Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result of these and other factors, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation can be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.. 50. Table of Contents. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our current or future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidates.. We have licensed certain intellectual property rights covering our current product candidates from Takeda. If, for any reason, the Takeda License Agreement is terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it could adversely affect our business. The Takeda License Agreement imposes, and any future collaboration agreements or license agreements we enter into are likely to impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture, and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology.. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.. Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on our business.. Third party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our patents or other proprietary rights, may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of relugolix, MVT-602, and any future product candidate.. Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, derivation, and administrative law proceedings, inter partes review, and post-grant review before the USPTO, as well as oppositions and similar processes in foreign jurisdictions. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product candidates or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are infringing their patents or employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We have conducted searches for information in support of patent protection and otherwise evaluate the patent landscape for relugolix and MVT-602, and, based on these searches and evaluations to date, we do not believe that there are valid patents which contain granted claims that could be asserted with respect to relugolix or MVT-602. However, we may be incorrect.. Also, there may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe.. 51. Table of Contents. In addition, third parties may obtain patent rights in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon rights. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.. Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our drugs or product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third parties.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the U.S., in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For the patents and patent applications that we have licensed, we may have limited or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business.. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Our business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.. 52. Table of Contents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares.. Changes in U.S. patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.. The U.S. has enacted and implemented wide-ranging patent reform legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future.. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could impair our business.. Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents covering relugolix, MVT-602, and any future product candidate throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection, but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.. Because we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture relugolix, MVT-602, and any future product candidates, and we expect to collaborate with third parties on the development of relugolix, MVT-602, and any future product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We also conduct joint R&D programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our R&D partnerships or similar agreements. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors, and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor's discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. In addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors, and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor's discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.. 53. Table of Contents. We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.. We employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our employees, collaborators, and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees' former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.. 54. Table of Contents. Risks Related to Our Common Shares. An active trading market for our common shares may not be sustained.. Although our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common shares will continue to be sustained. In addition, as a result of a large proportion of our common shares being held by passive investors (for example, RSL beneficially owning approximately 59.1% of our outstanding common shares as of June 4, 2018), trading in our common shares may be less liquid than the shares of companies with broader public active institutional investor ownership. If an active market for our common shares is not sustained, your ability to trade our shares may be limited. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling common shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common shares as consideration.. The market price of our common shares has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment.. The market price of our common shares has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:. • any delay in the commencement, enrollment, and ultimate completion of our clinical trials;. • actual or anticipated results of clinical trials of relugolix, MVT-602 or those of our competitors;. • any delay in filing an NDA or similar application for relugolix or MVT-602 and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA or other regulatory authority's review of that NDA or similar application, as the case may be;. • failure to successfully develop and commercialize relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate;. • inability to obtain additional funding;. • regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. or other countries or jurisdictions applicable to relugolix, MVT-602, or any future product candidate;. • adverse regulatory decisions;. • changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;. • inability to obtain adequate product supply for relugolix, MVT-602 or any future product candidate, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;. • introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;. • failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;. • failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;. • changes in the market valuations of similar companies;. • market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, and the issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;. • announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;. • variations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;. • changes in estimates of financial results or investment recommendations by securities analysts;. • significant lawsuits, including patent or shareholder litigation, and disputes or other developments relating to our proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;. • additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;. • short sales of our common shares;. • sales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares;. • sales or purchases of our common shares by our Section 16 officers;. 55. Table of Contents. • issuance of additional shares of our common shares, or the perception that such issuances may occur, including through our \"at-the-market\" offering program;. • negative coverage in the media or analyst reports, whether accurate or not;. • issuance of subpoenas or investigative demands, or the public fact of an investigation by a government agency, whether meritorious or not;. • trading liquidity of our common shares;. • investors' general perception of our company and our business;. • general political, economic, industry, and market conditions;. • effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events; and. • the other factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.. In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of our common shares, regardless of our actual operating performance.. Volatility in our share price could subject us to securities class action litigation.. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant share price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could harm our business.. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the applicable rules of the NYSE and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. If we rely on these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.. RSL controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common shares. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. We have elected to use certain of these exemptions and we may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future. As a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.. RSL owns a significant percentage of our common shares and is able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.. Based on our common shares outstanding as of March 31, 2018, RSL beneficially owns approximately 61.0% of the voting power of our outstanding common shares and has the ability to substantially influence us through this ownership position. For example, RSL and its shareholders may be able to control elections of directors, issuance of equity, including to our employees under equity incentive plans, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, amalgamation, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. RSL's interests may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other shareholders, and it may act in a manner with which you may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other shareholders. Further, RSL is a privately-held company whose ownership and governance structure is not transparent to our other shareholders. There may be changes to the management or ownership of RSL that could impact RSL's interests in a way that may not coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other shareholders. So long as RSL continues to own a significant amount of our equity, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.. Our organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interests.. Our organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between us and minority holders of our common shares, on the one hand, and RSL and its shareholders, on the other hand. Certain of our directors and employees have equity interests in RSL and, accordingly, their interests may be aligned with RSL's interests, which may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Further, our other shareholders may not have visibility into the RSL ownership of any of our directors or officers, which may change at any time through acquisition, disposition, dilution, or otherwise. Any change in our directors' or officers' RSL ownership could impact the interests of those holders.. 56. Table of Contents. In addition, we are party to certain related party agreements with RSL, RSI, and RSG. These entities and their shareholders, including certain of our directors and employees, may have interests which differ from our interests or those of the minority holders of our common shares. For example, we are party to an option agreement with RSL pursuant to which RSL granted to us an option to acquire the rights to products to which RSL or any nonpublic affiliate of RSL acquires the rights (other than a relugolix product or a competing product) for uterine fibroids or endometriosis, or for which the primary target indication is advanced prostate cancer. It is possible that we could fail to exercise our option with respect to a product candidate under this agreement and that product candidate is then successfully developed and commercialized by RSL or one of its other subsidiaries or affiliates. Any material transaction between us and RSL, RSI, or RSG is subject to our related party transaction policy, which requires prior approval of such transaction by our Audit Committee. To the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interests, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. If securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price could decline.. The trading market for our common shares depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates, or one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades their investment recommendation on our common shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price to decline.. Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, would be your sole source of gain.. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We are also subject to Bermuda legal constraints that may affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares and make other payments. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends is currently restricted by the terms of the NovaQuest Securities Purchase Agreement and the Hercules Loan Agreement. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common shares would be your sole source of gain on an investment in our common shares for the foreseeable future.. Future sales of our common shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, including through our \"at-the-market\" equity offering program could depress our common share price, even if our business is doing well.. Sales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception by investors that our shareholders intend to sell substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, could depress the market price of our common shares even if our business is doing well. Such a decrease in our share price could in turn impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.. All of the shares sold in our IPO and through our \"at-the market\" equity offering program, as well as shares issued upon the exercise of options granted to persons other than our officers and directors, are freely transferable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act. If our major shareholders, including RSL and Takeda, or any of our executive officers or directors were to sell a substantial portion of our common shares, or if the market perceived that RSL, Takeda or any of our executive officers or directors intends to sell our common shares, it could negatively affect our common share price.. We have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the common shares that may be issued under our equity incentive plan. In addition, we have filed an amended registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act to register the offer and sale of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of our securities, as well as the resale of up to 49,800 common shares held by Hercules. Sales of these common shares or the issuance of such securities may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares. In addition, in the future we may issue additional common shares or other securities if we need to raise additional capital. The number of our new common shares issued in connection with raising additional capital could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common shares and result in dilution to the market price of our common shares.. In April 2018, we entered into an \"at-the-market\" sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen pursuant to which we may sell from time to time, common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million through Cowen, acting as our agent.  Whether we choose to affect future sales under the \"at-the-market\" equity offering program will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, market conditions and the trading price of our common shares relative to other sources of capital.  The issuance from time to time of common shares through our \"at-the-market\" equity offering program or in any other equity offering, or the perception that such sales may occur, could have the effect of depressing the market price of our common shares.. 57. Table of Contents. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been and will be required to continue to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.. As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NYSE, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, changing rules and regulations may increase our legal and accounting compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations, and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management.. If we are unable to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common shares, may be adversely affected.. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. At such time as we are required to obtain auditor attestation, if we then have a material weakness, we would receive an adverse opinion regarding our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. We will be required to disclose significant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis.. We have begun the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. Our process to comply with Section 404 will result in substantial legal, accounting and other compliance expense and significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and finance staff and consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal control, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets.. In addition, effective disclosure controls and procedures enable us to make timely and accurate disclosure of financial and non-financial information that we are required to disclose. If our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results or make other disclosures accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results or other disclosures to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence and cause the market price of our common shares to decline.. 58. Table of Contents. We are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.. We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following November 1, 2021, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior September 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.. In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \"smaller reporting company\" which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.. We are a Bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers.. We are a Bermuda exempted company. As a result, the rights of our shareholders are governed by Bermuda law and our memorandum of association and bye-laws. The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in another jurisdiction. It may be difficult for investors to enforce in the U.S. judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is doubtful whether courts in Bermuda will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the U.S., against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Bermuda against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions.. Bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to our shareholders.. We are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. As a result, our corporate affairs are governed by the Bermuda Companies Act 1981, as amended, or the Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws typically applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, amalgamations, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits, and indemnification of directors. Generally, the duties of directors and officers of a Bermuda company are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Bermuda companies typically do not have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances. Shareholder class actions are not available under Bermuda law. The circumstances in which shareholder derivative actions may be available under Bermuda law are substantially more proscribed and less clear than they would be to shareholders of U.S. corporations. The Bermuda courts, however, would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal, or would result in the violation of the company's memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, consideration would be given by a Bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or, for instance, where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company's shareholders than those who actually approved it.. 59. Table of Contents. When the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some shareholders, one or more shareholders may apply to the Supreme Court of Bermuda, which may make such order as it sees fit, including an order regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company. Additionally, under our bye-laws and as permitted by Bermuda law, each shareholder has waived any claim or right of action against our directors or officers for any action taken by directors or officers in the performance of their duties, except for actions involving fraud or dishonesty. In addition, the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Bermuda law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the U.S., particularly the State of Delaware. Therefore, our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction within the U.S.. There are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our common shares.. Common shares may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Bermuda Investment Business Act 2003, which regulates the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, the Bermuda Monetary Authority must approve all issues and transfers of shares of a Bermuda exempted company. However, the Bermuda Monetary Authority has, pursuant to its statement of June 1, 2005, given its general permission under the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations for the issue and free transfer of our common shares to and among persons who are non-residents of Bermuda for exchange control purposes as long as the shares are listed on an appointed stock exchange, which includes the NYSE. Additionally, we have sought and have obtained a specific permission from the Bermuda Monetary Authority for the issue and transfer of our common shares up to the amount of our authorized capital from time to time, and options, warrants, depository receipts, rights, loan notes, debt instruments, and our other securities to persons resident and non-resident for exchange control purposes with the need for prior approval of such issue or transfer. The general permission or the specific permission would cease to apply if we were to cease to be listed on the NYSE or another appointed stock exchange.. Our bye-laws enable our board of directors to issue preference shares, which may discourage a change of control.. Our bye-laws contain provisions that enable our board of directors to determine the powers, preferences, and rights of our preference shares and to issue the preference shares without shareholder approval.. This could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of this provision may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if it is viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.. The voting power of your common shares may be reduced without your further consent.. Under our amended and restated bye-laws, in the event that any U.S. person holds, directly, indirectly or constructively, 9.5% or more of the total voting power of our issued share capital, excluding any U.S. person that held, directly, indirectly or constructively, 9.5% or more of the total voting power of issued share capital immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, the aggregate votes conferred by the common shares held by such person (or by any person through which such U.S. person indirectly or constructively holds shares) will be reduced by our board of directors to the extent necessary such that the common shares held, directly, indirectly or constructively, by such U.S. person will constitute less than 9.5% of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares. RSL and certain of its affiliates are not subject to these provisions. Further, our board of directors may determine that shares shall carry different or no voting rights as it reasonably determines, based on the advice of counsel, to be appropriate to (1) avoid the existence of any U.S. person who holds 9.5% or more of the total voting power of our issued share capital or (2) avoid adverse tax, legal or regulatory consequences to us, any subsidiary of ours or any holder of our common shares or its affiliates. These provisions may discourage potential investors from acquiring a stake or making a significant investment in our company, as well as discourage a takeover attempt, which may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit of any such transactions as well as adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.. We may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities and higher effective tax rates.. We are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, where we are not subject to any income or withholding taxes. We are centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom, and under current U.K. tax law, a company which is centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom is regarded as resident in the United Kingdom for taxation purposes. We may also become subject to income, withholding or other taxes in certain jurisdictions by reason of our activities and operations, and it is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert that we are subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. Any such additional tax liability could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, Myovant Sciences GmbH is our principal operating company for conducting our business and the entity that holds our intellectual property rights in relugolix and MVT-602. The establishment of this Swiss entity as our principal operating company and the transfer of our intellectual property rights to this entity may result in a higher overall effective tax rate.. 60. Table of Contents. The intended tax effects of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business.. We and RSL, our principal shareholder, are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. We currently have subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Ireland, and the U.S. If we succeed in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased operations through our subsidiaries in various countries and tax jurisdictions, in part through intercompany service agreements between us, our parent company, and our subsidiaries. In that case, our corporate structure and intercompany transactions, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, will be organized so that we can achieve our business objectives in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules and regulations. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries or tax jurisdictions, the tax laws and regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arm's length and that appropriate documentation be maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities.. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles, and interpretations. As we intend to operate in numerous countries and taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm's length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, on December 22, 2017, \"an Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018,\" commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted in the United States, which introduced a comprehensive set of tax reforms. We continue to assess the impact of such tax reform legislation on our business and may determine that changes to our structure, practice or tax positions are necessary in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Certain impacts of this legislation have been taken into account, including the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from the previous 35 percent to 21 percent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in conjunction with the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, however, may require consideration of changes to our structure and the manner in which we conduct our business. Such changes may nevertheless be ineffective in avoiding an increase in our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm's length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods.. Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax rates, tax laws, tax practice, tax treaties or tax regulations or changes in the interpretation thereof by the tax authorities in Europe (including the United Kingdom and Switzerland), the U.S., Bermuda, and other jurisdictions, as well as being affected by certain changes currently proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and their action plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Such changes may become more likely as a result of recent economic trends in the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly if such trends continue. If such a situation was to arise, it could adversely impact our tax position and our effective tax rate. Failure to manage the risks associated with such changes, or misinterpretation of the laws providing such changes, could result in costly audits, interest, penalties, and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, results of our operations, and our financial condition.. Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including: (1) the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; (2) the resolution of issues arising from any future tax audits with various tax authorities; (3) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (4) increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; (5) changes in the taxation of share-based compensation; (6) changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and (7) challenges to the transfer pricing policies related to our structure.. 61. Table of Contents. U.S. holders that own 10% or more of the vote or value of our common shares may suffer adverse tax consequences because we and/or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are expected to be characterized as a \"controlled foreign corporation,\" or a CFC, under Section 957(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.. A non-U.S. corporation is considered a CFC if more than 50 percent of (1) the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote, or (2) the total value of the stock of such corporation, is owned, or is considered as owned by applying certain constructive ownership rules, by United States shareholders (U.S. persons who own stock representing 10% or more of the vote or, for taxable years of non-U.S. corporations beginning after December 31, 2017 and for taxable years of shareholders with or within which such taxable years of non-U.S. corporations end, 10% or more of the value) on any day during the taxable year of such non-U.S. corporation. Certain United States shareholders of a CFC generally are required to include currently in gross income such shareholders' share of the CFC's \"Subpart F income\", a portion of the CFC's earnings to the extent the CFC holds certain U.S. property, and a portion of the CFC's \"global intangible low-taxed income\" (as defined under Section 951A of the Code). Such United States shareholders are subject to current U.S. federal income tax with respect to such items, even if the CFC has not made an actual distribution to such shareholders. \"Subpart F income\" includes, among other things, certain passive income (such as income from dividends, interests, royalties, rents and annuities or gain from the sale of property that produces such types of income) and certain sales and services income arising in connection with transactions between the CFC and a person related to the CFC.  \"Global intangible low-taxed income\" may include most of the remainder of a CFC's income over a deemed return on its tangible assets.. As a result of certain changes in the U.S. tax law introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we believe that we and our non-U.S. subsidiaries are classified as CFCs in the current taxable year. For U.S. holders who hold 10% or more of the vote or value of our common shares, this may result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, such as current U.S. taxation of Subpart F income and of any such shareholder's share of our accumulated non-U.S. earnings and profits (regardless of whether we make any distributions), taxation of amounts treated as global intangible low-taxed income under Section 951A of the Code with respect to such shareholder, and being subject to certain reporting requirements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Any such U.S. holder who is an individual generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a U.S. corporation.  If you are a U.S. holder who holds 10% or more of the vote or value of our common shares, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning, or disposing our common shares and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, especially the changes to the rules relating to CFCs.. U.S. holders of our common shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company.. Generally, if, for any taxable year, at least 75% of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of our assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. Additionally, a look-through rule generally applies with respect to 25% or more owned subsidiaries. If we are characterized as a PFIC, U.S. holders of our common shares may suffer adverse tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain, the loss of the preferential tax rate applicable to dividends received on our common shares by individuals who are U.S. holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and the proceeds of sales of our common shares.. Our status as a PFIC will depend on the nature and composition of our income and the nature, composition and value of our assets from time to time. The 50% passive asset test described above is generally based on the fair market value of each asset, with the value of goodwill and going concern value determined in large part by reference to the market value of our common shares, which may be volatile. Our status may also depend, in part, on how quickly we utilize the cash proceeds from our IPO and subsequent financings in our business. With respect to the taxable year that ended on March 31, 2018 and foreseeable future taxable years, we believe that we were not a PFIC and presently do not anticipate that we will be a PFIC based upon the expected value of our assets, including any goodwill, and the expected nature and composition of our income and assets. However, our status as a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis and we cannot provide any assurances regarding our PFIC status for the current or future taxable years.. In the event that we receive passive income in the future that would cause us to be a PFIC, we would expect to evaluate and may implement alternative structures and arrangements including structures and arrangements intended to mitigate the possibility that we will be classified as a PFIC. The failure or inability to implement such structures or arrangements may have an adverse impact on the determination of whether we are classified as a PFIC.. 62. Table of Contents"
