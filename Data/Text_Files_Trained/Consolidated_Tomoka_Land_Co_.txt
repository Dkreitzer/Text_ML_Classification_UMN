[1] "ITEM 1A.              RISK FACTORS. Our business is subject to a number of significant risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks which potentially could impact our business. These additional risks include those which are unknown now or that are currently considered immaterial. If any of the circumstances, events, or developments described below actually occur to a significant degree, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should carefully consider the following risks and all the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.. A prolonged downturn in economic conditions, especially in Daytona Beach, Florida, could adversely impact our business. In recent years, the collapse of the housing market, together with the crisis in the credit markets, resulted in a recession in the local and national economy with significant levels of unemployment, shrinking gross domestic product, and drastically reduced consumer spending. During this period, potential consumers of residential real estate often deferred or avoided real estate purchases due to, among other factors, a lack of liquidity, the substantial costs involved, and overall uncertainty with the economy. The real estate industry is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions which are outside of our control, such as short and long-term interest rates, housing demand,. 14. Table of Contents. population growth, and unemployment levels and job growth. Our real estate operations segment is especially sensitive to economic conditions in Florida, particularly in Daytona Beach, where substantially all our land portfolio is located. While Florida has experienced improving economic conditions, the recovery for Florida started later and has taken longer than the rest of the nation. A prolonged period of economic weakness or another downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.. We may experience a decline in the fair value of our real estate assets or investments which could result in impairments and would impact our financial condition and results of operations. A decline in the fair market value of our long-lived assets may require us to recognize an \"other-than-temporary\" impairment against such assets (as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") authoritative accounting guidance) if certain conditions or circumstances related to an asset were to change and we were to determine that, with respect to any such asset, there was an unrealized loss to the fair value of the asset. The fair value of our long-lived assets depends on market conditions, including estimates of future demand for these assets, and the revenues that can be generated from such applicable assets including land or an income property. If such a determination were to be made, we would recognize the estimated unrealized losses through earnings and write down the depreciated or amortized cost of such assets to a new cost basis, based on the fair value of such assets on the date they are considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Such impairment charges reflect non-cash losses at the time of recognition; subsequent disposition or sale of such assets could further affect our future losses or gains, as they are based on the difference between the sales price received and the adjusted depreciated or amortized cost of such assets at the time of sale.. The most recent downturn in the U.S. economy and real estate markets caused the fair value of certain of our properties to decrease. In 2011, we wrote down the carrying value of our golf operations assets and certain of our land assets with corresponding non-cash charges against our earnings to reflect the impaired value. In the last few years we have written down the carrying value of several small parcels of land reacquired through foreclosure in 2009 when portions of this reacquired land was under a contract to be sold for a price that was less than the carrying value of the land. If the real estate market were to experience another decline, we may be required to take other impairment charges against our earnings for other than temporary impairments in the value of our real estate assets including our land, income properties, commercial loan investments and similar financings or other capitalized costs. Any such non-cash charges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our quarterly results are subject to variability. We have historically derived a substantial portion of our income from transactions in our land holdings. The timing of such real estate transactions is not predictable and is generally subject to the purchaser's ability to, among other things, obtain on a timely basis acceptable financing and approvals from local municipalities and regulatory agencies for the intended use of the land or the issuance of permits related to wetlands mitigation. As these approvals are subject to third party responses, it is not uncommon for delays to occur, which affect the timing of transaction closings and may also impact the terms and conditions of the transaction. These timing issues have caused, and may continue to cause, our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.. Our future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to successfully execute our strategy to invest in income-producing assets.  There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our strategy of investing in income-producing assets, including income properties and possibly commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate. There is no assurance that the income property portfolio will expand at all, or if it expands, at any specified rate or to any specified size. If we continue to invest in diverse geographic markets other than the markets in which we currently own properties, we will be subject to risks associated with investing in new markets as those markets will be relatively unfamiliar to us. In addition, investments in new markets may introduce increased costs to us relating to factors including the regulatory environment and the local and state tax structure. Additionally, there is no assurance we will or can expand our investments in commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate. Consequently, if we are unable to acquire additional income-producing assets or our investments in new markets introduce increased costs our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely affected.. We operate in a highly competitive market for the acquisition of income properties and more established competitors may be able to compete more effectively for acquisition opportunities than we can. A number of entities and other investors compete with us to purchase income properties. We compete with REITs, public and private real estate focused companies, high wealth individual investors, and others. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several of our public company competitors have greater access to raising equity or debt financing, have significant amounts of capital available and investment objectives that overlap with ours, which may create competition for acquisition opportunities. Some competitors may have. 15. Table of Contents. a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of income property acquisitions and establish more relationships than us. We cannot be assured that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and therefore our cash flows. Also, because of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and purchase assets that are consistent with our objectives.. If we are not successful in utilizing the like-kind exchange structure in deploying the proceeds from our land transactions or dispositions of income properties, or our like-kind exchange transactions are disqualified, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Our strategy of investing in income-producing properties includes the utilization, when possible, of proceeds obtained from the disposition of income properties or from land transactions, which qualify for deferral of the applicable income tax through the like-kind exchange provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If we fail to complete a qualifying acquisition utilizing the aforementioned proceeds, or a transaction we deemed qualifying for like-kind exchange treatment is subsequently disqualified by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be subject to increased income taxes, which may adversely impact our results of operations and our cash flows.. If the provisions of section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the like-kind exchange structure were altered substantially or eliminated, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. A fundamental element of our strategy is investing in income-producing properties utilizing, when possible, the proceeds obtained from the disposition of our land holdings, Subsurface Interests and in some instances our income properties, which qualify for deferral of the applicable income tax through the like-kind exchange provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. If the provisions of section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code regarding the like-kind exchange structure, including the deferral of taxes on gains related to the sale of real property such as our land holdings, Subsurface Interests and income properties, were to be altered substantially or eliminated, we may be subject to increased income taxes, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.. We are subject to a number of risks inherent with the real estate industry and in the ownership of real estate assets or investment in financings secured by real estate, which may adversely affect our returns from our investments, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Factors beyond our control can affect the performance and value of our real estate assets including our land and Subsurface Interests, income properties, investments in commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate or other investments. Real estate assets are subject to various risks, including but not limited to the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tAdverse changes in national, regional, and local economic and market conditions where our properties are located;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCompetition from other real estate companies similar to ours and competition for tenants, including competition based on rental rates, age and location of the property and the quality of maintenance, insurance, and management services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants or decreases in market rental rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tZoning or other local regulatory restrictions, or other factors pertaining to the local government institutions which inhibit interest in the markets in which our land holdings or income producing assets are located;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCosts associated with the need to periodically repair, renovate or re-lease our properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIncreases in the cost of our operations, particularly maintenance, insurance, or real estate taxes which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in our revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies, and ordinances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCommodities prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIlliquidity of real estate investments which may limit our ability to modify our income producing asset portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tActs of God, including natural disasters, which may result in uninsured losses; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tActs of war or terrorism, including consequences of terrorist attacks.. 16. Table of Contents. If any of these or similar events occurs, it may reduce our return from an affected real estate asset or investment which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. The loss of revenues from our income property portfolio or certain tenants would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. While no single tenant represents more than 10% of our consolidated revenues as of December 31, 2017, we have tenants who represent a large amount of our net operating income and/or a large percentage of the square footage of our income property portfolio. These tenants include Wells Fargo, Lowe's Corporation, Hilton Grand Vacations, and At Home. The default, financial distress, or bankruptcy of one or all of these tenants could cause substantial vacancies in our income property portfolio and reduce our revenues from our income property operations significantly, thereby adversely impacting our results of operations and cash flows. Vacancies reduce our revenue until the affected properties can be re-leased and could decrease the value of each such vacant property. Upon the expiration of the leases that are currently in place, we may not be able to re-lease a vacant property at a comparable lease rate or without incurring additional expenditures in connection with such re-leasing. If, following the loss of an income property tenant, we are unable to re-lease the income property at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.. Certain provisions of the Company's leases may be unenforceable. The Company's rights and obligations with respect to its leases are governed by written agreements with its tenants. A court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable, such as a particular remedy, a termination provision, or a provision governing the Company's remedies for default of the tenant. If we were unable to enforce provisions of a lease agreement or agreements, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.. We may not be able to dispose of properties we target for sale to recycle our capital. While the Company's strategy may include selectively selling non-core or other income-producing properties to recycle our capital, we may be unable to sell properties targeted for disposition due to adverse market or other conditions or not achieve the pricing or timing that is consistent with our expectations. This may adversely affect, among other things, the Company's ability to deploy capital into the acquisition of other income-producing properties, the execution of our overall operating strategy and consequently our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Our development activities, including the development of new income properties or the redevelopment or renovation of existing income properties, may cause us to experience unexpected costs and have other risks that may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We have recently and may in the future develop new income properties. In addition, we have in recent years and may in the future redevelop, significantly renovate or otherwise invest additional capital in certain of our existing income properties to improve the assets and enhance the opportunity for increased returns on our overall investment. These various development activities, particularly the development of new income properties, is subject to a number of risks, including risks associated with construction work and risks of cost overruns due to construction delays or other factors that may increase the anticipated costs of a project. Furthermore, the commencement of development projects is subject to other risks including the receipt of zoning or other required governmental permits and authorizations. In addition, we may incur development costs in connection with projects that are ultimately not pursued to completion. Any of the development activities noted may be financed under our existing revolving credit facility or through other forms of financing. If such financing is not available on acceptable terms, our development activities may not be pursued or may be curtailed. In addition, such development activities would likely reduce the available borrowing capacity on our credit facility which we use for the acquisition of income properties and other operating needs. The risks associated with development activities, including but not necessarily limited to those noted, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.. In certain instances, we may conduct certain development activities on our land, including preparing a site for vertical development or completing the actual development of new income properties which may cause us to be unable to utilize the like-kind exchange structure for a subsequent sale of the land which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In the future, we may perform the site work necessary for vertical development or the development of new income properties on land we own. After conducting development activities on our land, including, but not limited to, either of the noted development activities, a sale of the improved land may not qualify for treatment under the like-kind exchange structure. As a result, in conjunction with a land sale that does not utilize the like-kind exchange structure, we may be subject to increased income taxes, which may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and our cash flows.. 17. Table of Contents. Most of our land holdings are located in Daytona Beach, Florida and the competition in the local and regional market, the possible impact of government regulation, permitting or development limitations, and the criteria used by parties interested in acquiring land could adversely impact the interest in our land and thereby our results of operations and cash flows. The parties typically interested in our land holdings base their decision to acquire land on, among other things, price, location, ability to entitle the land, and land use or optionality of land use, ability to obtain zoning, entitlements, and permitting. In some instances, the aforementioned acquisition criteria or other factors may make an interested party consider other land instead of ours. In addition, parties interested in acquiring our land holdings would likely consider the impact of governmental regulations or ordinances on their ability to entitle and develop the land for their intended use and may seek incentives or similar economic considerations from one or more governmental authorities that they may not be able to obtain. These conditions may make it difficult for us to complete land transactions on acceptable terms or at all, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The Company's real estate investments, including our land holdings and income-producing assets, are generally illiquid. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid; therefore, it may be difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises, and otherwise the Company's ability to make rapid adjustments in the size and content of our income property portfolio or other real estate assets in response to economic or other conditions is limited. Illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility, as a ready market does not exist, and can be more difficult to value. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of certain of our real estate assets or income producing asset portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. Further, certain expenditures necessary to operate our income property operations, real estate operations and golf operations generally do not decrease and may in fact increase in response to weakening economic conditions or other market disruptions, which expenditures may include maintenance costs, insurance costs, and in some instances, interest expense. This relationship of revenue and expenditures may result, under certain market conditions, in reduced operating results and cash flows and thereby could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.. Continued or increased operating losses from the golf operations may adversely impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows. The Company has golf operations consisting of the LPGA International Golf Club, a semi-private golf club in Daytona Beach, Florida, consisting of the following: two 18-hole golf courses, a food and beverage operation, a private event operation, and club memberships. A third party manages these operations, on behalf of the Company, and employs the personnel. Since its inception, the golf operation has generated negative cash flows. In 2011, the Company recognized an impairment of approximately $4.0 million on the long-lived assets of the golf operations. In January 2017, the Company invested an additional $1.6 million of capital in the golf operations to buy-out of the long-term land lease with the City and approximately $350,000 to renovate the greens on one of the 18-hole golf courses. The results of operations from the golf operations are subject to the typical execution risks inherent with many golf, retail and club operations including, but not limited to: maintenance, merchandising, pricing, customer service, competition, cost of food, beverage and retail products, consumer preferences and behavior, safety, compliance with various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, environmental contamination, weather conditions, or other trends in the local market. Although the negative cash flows generated by the golf operations decreased substantially, any one of these execution risk factors could negatively impact the golf operations and thereby adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Competition, seasonality and market conditions relating to golf operations could adversely affect our operating results. Our golf operations face competition from similar golf operations in the surrounding areas, primarily Daytona Beach and other areas of Volusia County. Any new competition from golf operations that are developed close to our existing golf operations may adversely impact the results of our golf operations. Our golf operations are also subject to changes in market conditions, such as population trends, consumer demand and changing demographics of people playing golf, any of which could adversely affect results of operations. In addition, our golf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularity of golf continues to decrease, or if unusual weather conditions or other factors cause a reduction in rounds played. Our golf operations are also seasonal, primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season, Florida's summer heat and rain, and the hurricane season. Should any of these factors impact our golf operations unfavorably, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be impacted adversely.. The revenues from our golf operations depend on a third-party operator that we do not control. We currently utilize a third-party to manage and operate our golf operations. As a result, we do not directly implement operating business decisions with respect to the operation and marketing of our golf operations and personnel decisions. For our golf operations, these decisions may concern course maintenance, membership programs, marketing programs, and employee. 18. Table of Contents. matters. The amount of revenue that we generate from the golf operations is dependent on the ability of the third-party manager to maintain and seek to increase the gross receipts and manage and possibly decrease the expenses at LPGA International. If the revenues from our golf operations decline or the operating expenses increase at a rate that is inconsistent with revenues, our results of operations and our cash flows would be adversely affected, and our financial condition may be adversely impacted should we be required to recognize additional impairments on the long-lived assets of the golf operations, including our recently invested capital.. Our investment strategy may involve credit risk. As part of our business strategy, we have invested in commercial loans secured by commercial real estate and may in the future invest in other commercial loans or similar financings secured by real estate. Investments in commercial loans or similar financings of real estate involve credit risk with regard to the borrower, the borrower's operations and the real estate that secures the financing. The credit risks include, but are not limited to, the ability of the borrower to execute their business plan and strategy, the ability of the borrower to sustain and/or improve the operating results generated by the collateral property, the ability of the borrower to continue as a going concern, and the risk associated with the market or industry in which the collateral property is utilized. Our evaluation of the investment opportunity in a mortgage loan or similar financing includes these elements of credit risk as well as other underwriting criteria and factors. Further, we may rely on third party resources to assist us in our investment evaluation process and otherwise in conducting customary due diligence. Our underwriting of the investment or our estimates of credit risk may not prove to be accurate, as actual results may vary from our estimates. In the event we underestimate the performance of the borrower and/or the underlying real estate which secures our commercial loan or financing, we may experience losses or unanticipated costs regarding our investment and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be adversely impacted.. Because of competition, we may not be able to acquire commercial loans or similar financings at all or at favorable yields. We may not be able to execute our strategy of acquiring commercial loans or similar financings at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. We compete with many other investment groups including REITs, public and private investment funds, life insurance companies, commercial and investment banks, and commercial finance companies, including some of the third parties with which we expect to have relationships. In most instances the competition has greater financial capacity, larger organizations and operating presence in the market. As a result, we may not be able to acquire commercial loans or similar financings in the future at all or at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows and would likely result in the need for any growth in our portfolio of income-producing assets to be achieved through the acquisition of income properties.. Debt and preferred equity investments could cause us to incur expenses, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We currently own, or may own in the future, investments in first mortgages, mezzanine loans, junior participations and preferred equity interests. Such investments may or may not be recourse obligations of the borrower and are not insured or guaranteed by governmental agencies or otherwise. In the event of a default under these obligations, we may have to take possession of the collateral securing these interests including through foreclosure proceedings. Borrowers may contest enforcement of foreclosure or our other remedies, and may seek bankruptcy protection to potentially block our actions to enforce their obligations to us. Relatively high loan-to-value ratios and declines in the value of the underlying collateral property may prevent us from realizing an amount equal to our investment upon foreclosure or realization even if we make substantial improvements or repairs to the underlying real estate to maximize such property's investment potential. Although we maintain and regularly evaluate financial reserves to properly accrue for potential future losses, our reserves would reflect management's judgment of the probability and severity of losses and the value of the underlying collateral. We cannot be certain that our judgment will prove to be correct and that our reserves, if any, will be adequate over time to protect against future losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific properties, assets, tenants, borrowers, industries in which our tenants and borrowers operate or markets in which our tenants and borrowers, or their properties are located. If we are unable to enforce our contractual rights, including but not limited to, taking possession of the collateral property in a foreclosure circumstance, or our reserves for credit losses prove inadequate, we could suffer losses which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The mezzanine loan assets that we may acquire will involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties. We may acquire mezzanine loans, which generally take the form of subordinated loans secured by the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. In the event of a bankruptcy of the. 19. Table of Contents. entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security, we may not have full recourse to the assets of such entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or the debt that is senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will only be satisfied after the senior debt has been satisfied. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our initial investment. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. Significant losses related to our mezzanine loans would result in operating losses for us and could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows.. We may invest in fixed-rate loan investments, and an increase in interest rates may adversely affect the value of these investments, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Increases in interest rates may negatively affect the market value of our investments, particularly any fixed-rate commercial loans or other financings we have invested in. Generally, any fixed-rate commercial loans or other financings will be more negatively affected by rising interest rates than adjustable-rate assets. We are required to reduce the book value of our investments by the amount of any decrease in their fair value. Reductions in the fair value of our investments could decrease the amounts we may borrow to purchase additional commercial loan or similar financing investments, which could impact our ability to increase our operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, if our borrowing costs are rising while our interest income is fixed for the fixed-rate investments, the spread between our borrowing costs and the fixed-rate we earn on the commercial loans or similar financing investments will contract or could become negative which would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The commercial loans or similar financings we currently own or may acquire that are secured by commercial real estate typically depend on the ability of the property owner to generate income from operating the property. Failure to do so may result in delinquency and/or foreclosure. Commercial loans are secured by commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and therefore the risk of loss. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In the event of any default under a commercial loan held directly by us, we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the commercial loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In the event of the bankruptcy of a commercial loan borrower, the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law. Foreclosure of a loan can be an expensive and lengthy process, which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed commercial loan. If the borrower is unable to repay a mortgage loan or similar financing our inability to foreclose on the asset in a timely manner, and/or our inability to obtain value from reselling or otherwise disposing of the asset for an amount equal to our investment basis, would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. The activities or actions of a third-party servicer engaged to service our investment in a commercial loan or similar debt financing could adversely impact the value of our investment or our results of operations and cash flows. Our investments in first mortgages, mezzanine loans or other debt financings secured by real estate may require a third-party servicer to service the loan on our behalf and/or on behalf of third parties who have invested in some portion of the debt financing. An intended or unintended breach by the servicer with regard to their servicing of the debt financing or in their contractual obligations and fiduciary duties to us or the other holders of the debt financing could adversely impact the value of our investment or our results of operations and cash flows.. We may suffer losses when a borrower defaults on a loan and the value of the underlying collateral is less than the amount due. If a borrower defaults on a non-recourse loan, we will only have recourse to the real estate-related assets collateralizing the loan. If the underlying collateral value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a loss. Conversely, some of our commercial loans may be unsecured or are secured only by equity interests in the borrowing entities. These loans are subject to the risk that other lenders in the capital stack may be directly secured by the real estate assets of the borrower or may otherwise have a superior right to repayment. Upon a default, those collateralized lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying real estate. In such cases, we may lack control over the underlying asset collateralizing our loan or the underlying assets of the borrower before a default and, as a result, the value of the collateral may be reduced by acts or omissions by owners or managers of the assets. In addition, the value of. 20. Table of Contents. the underlying real estate may be adversely affected by some or all of the risks referenced above that pertain to the income-producing properties that we own.. Some of our commercial loans may be backed by individual or corporate guarantees from borrowers or their affiliates which guarantees are not secured. If the guarantees are not fully or partially secured, we typically rely on financial covenants from borrowers and guarantors which are designed to require the borrower or guarantor to maintain certain levels of creditworthiness. Where we do not have recourse to specific collateral pledged to satisfy such guarantees or recourse loans, we will only have recourse as an unsecured creditor to the general assets of the borrower or guarantor, some or all of which may be pledged as collateral for other lenders. There can be no assurance that a borrower or guarantor will comply with its financial covenants, or that sufficient assets will be available to pay amounts owed to us under our loans and guarantees. Because of these factors, we may suffer additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.. Upon a borrower bankruptcy, we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower to satisfy our loan. Additionally, in some instances, our loans may be subordinate to other debt of certain borrowers. If a borrower defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or a borrower files for bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt receives payment. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of inter-creditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through \"standstill\" periods), and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings. Bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase collection costs and the time needed for us to acquire title to the underlying collateral (if applicable), during which time the collateral and/or a borrower's financial condition may decline in value, causing us to suffer additional losses.. If the value of collateral underlying a loan declines, or interest rates increase during the term of a loan, a borrower may not be able to obtain the necessary funds to repay our loan at maturity through refinancing because the underlying property revenue cannot satisfy the debt service coverage requirements necessary to obtain new financing. If a borrower is unable to repay our loan at maturity, we could suffer additional loss which may adversely impact our financial performance.. As a result of any of the above factors or events, the losses we may suffer could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Investments in securities of companies operating in the real estate industry, including debt and equity instruments such as corporate bonds, preferred or common stock, or convertible instruments could cause us to incur losses or other expenses which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We have owned and may own in the future, investments in corporate securities of companies operating in the real estate industry including debt and equity instruments such as corporate bonds, preferred or common stock, or convertible instruments. Certain of these investments may be traded on an exchange or other active market whereby the price of the underlying instrument is quoted daily and those quoted prices and thus the market value of the instrument varies during a given trading day. Certain of these investments may be traded on an exchange or market that is not deemed an active market but where the price of the investment fluctuates daily or otherwise. Adverse fluctuations in the value of these investments, whether market-generated or not, are reflected as unrealized losses on our balance sheet. We may choose to or be required to liquidate these investments in whole or in part and at prices that result in realized losses on our investment. Should we incur realized losses on liquidating these investments, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.. The Company may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or additional borrowings may impact our liquidity. In order to further our business objectives, we may seek to obtain additional debt financing or raise equity capital and may be unable to do so on favorable terms, if at all. We may obtain unsecured debt financing in addition to our revolving credit facility which could decrease our borrowing capacity on the credit facility. Other sources of available capital may be materially more expensive or available under terms that are materially more restrictive than the Company's existing debt capital. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. An increase in our borrowing costs would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. While we have no short-term maturities in our long-term debt, should we seek to incur additional debt to help finance our acquisitions, increased interest rates would reduce the difference, or spread, that we may earn between the yield on the investments we make and the cost of the leverage we employ to finance such investments. It is possible that the spread on investments could be reduced to a point at which the profitability from investments would be significantly reduced or. 21. Table of Contents. eliminated entirely. This would adversely affect our returns on our assets, and therefore adversely impact our financial condition, our results of operations, and cash flows, and could require us to liquidate certain or all of these assets.. The Company's revolving credit facility and secured financings include certain financial and/or other covenants that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the required payment of such debt. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $70.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and $55.0 million of secured debt. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants which include, among others, a maximum total indebtedness and limits on the repurchase of the Company's stock and similar restrictions. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants pertaining to debt service coverage ratios, maximum levels of investment in certain types of assets, the number and make-up of the properties in the borrowing base, and similar covenants typical for this type of indebtedness. The Company's secured indebtedness generally contains covenants regarding debt service coverage ratios. The Company's ability to meet or maintain compliance with these and other debt covenants may be dependent on the performance by the Company's tenants under their leases. The Company's failure to comply with certain of our debt covenants could result in a default that may, if not cured, accelerate the payment under such debt and limit the Company's available cash flow for acquisitions, dividends, or operating costs, which would likely have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, these defaults could impair the Company's access to the debt and equity markets.. Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Company's $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Notes (the \"Notes\"), depends on our future operating and financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.. We continue to have the ability to incur debt; if we incur substantial additional debt, the higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the interest and principal of our debt. Despite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future (subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments), some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing our Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured, or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of, and interest on, our outstanding debt and our creditworthiness generally.. Certain investors in the convertible debt issuance may also invest in our common stock utilizing trading strategies which may increase the volatility in or adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Investors in, and potential purchasers of, the Notes may employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors that employ a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to our convertible debt instruments typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling our common stock. These strategies, particularly the effect short sales or equity swaps with respect to our common stock, could increase the volatility of our stock price or otherwise adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.. We may not have the liquidity or ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or purchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon a purchase or conversion of the Notes. Following certain potential events qualifying as a fundamental change under the indenture governing the Notes, including a change in control, holders of Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or a prepayment event under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in. 22. Table of Contents. lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price or make cash payments upon conversion. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversion. Our failure to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or make cash payments upon conversion thereof when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of the settlement of our Notes, conversions of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes into common stock. To the extent we issue shares of our common stock to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation pursuant to the Notes, the conversion of some or all of the Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.. The fundamental change purchase feature of our Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company. The terms of the Notes require us to offer to purchase the Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture agreement of the Notes. A non-stock takeover of the Company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.. The conditional conversion feature of our Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert their Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.. The accounting method for our Notes, which may be settled in cash, may have a material effect on our reported financial results. Under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented because of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock.. Convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle in cash or that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.. 23. Table of Contents. Declines in value of the assets in which we invest will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and make it costlier to finance these assets. Generally, we use our income property investments as collateral for our financings or as the borrowing base for our credit facility. Any decline in their value, a significant decrease in the rent received from the portfolio, or perceived market uncertainty about their value, could make it difficult for us to obtain or renew financing on favorable terms or at all, or maintain our compliance with terms of any financing arrangements already in place.. Our operations could be negatively impacted by the loss of key management personnel. We believe our future success depends, to a significant extent, on the efforts of each member of the Company's senior management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The loss of, or our inability to replace, any member of senior management could adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute our business strategies and thereby our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain key man life insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, but we do not have key man life insurance policies on the other members of our senior management.. The Company has a single shareholder that beneficially owns approximately 28% of the Company's outstanding common stock and exercises the related voting rights of those shares. The significance of its investment and its recent actions could have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our stock, and business operations, as well as potentially impact the investment decisions of other shareholder or interested parties.  Wintergreen Advisers, LLC, an institutional investment advisory firm (\"Wintergreen\"), manages Wintergreen Fund (NYSE: WGRNX), a public mutual fund (the \"Fund\") and other investment vehicles that, based on Wintergreen's public statements, collectively beneficially own approximately 28% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Based on publicly available information, in the past five years, the total value of assets under management in the Fund has decreased over 50% and as a result the Fund's ownership of our shares has become an increasingly more significant component of the Fund and may be the largest holding of the Fund. Based on the average daily trading volume of our shares, Wintergreen would be unable to dispose of its shares within a reasonable time, even if its sales constituted the entire trading volume each day. This limits Wintergreen's liquidity in its shares of the Company. Compliance with certain new regulatory requirements that will require disclosure of ownership and valuation of illiquid stocks may lead the Fund to liquidate some of the shares it owns in the Company. Any significant liquidation of shares by Wintergreen, depending upon the number of shares sold and the manner in which those shares are liquidated, could have an adverse impact on our stock price. The circumstances outlined above, which could lead the Fund to choose to liquidate, or be required to liquidate, some or all of its investment in the Company's shares, could potentially impact the investment decisions and related activity of existing shareholders or other interested parties, which could adversely impact the trading price of the Company's stock. Further, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and continuing through the present, the Company has received communications from Wintergreen, and Wintergreen has made public statements which have led and will likely lead to the Company having to incur costs for financial advisory services, legal representation, accounting services, proxy advisory services and other third-party costs to address any proposals, claims, allegations or other matters contained in these communications and statements or because of other actions taken by Wintergreen. Included in Wintergreen's activities have been a contested director election and related solicitation of proxies in conjunction with our 2017 annual shareholder meeting, in which Wintergreen sought to have four director candidates elected to our board of directors which, given the size of our board, would have given Wintergreen control of the Company. The aforementioned costs include those incurred by the Company to engage in the proxy contest last year. Such costs, while not reasonably estimable, may represent significant costs for the Company which would have an adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. The Company has several shareholders that beneficially own more than 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock and exercise the related voting rights of those shares. Actions by these shareholders, including trading activity, could have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our stock. Certain of our shareholders, specifically several institutional investment funds, including Wintergreen, each beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The daily trading activity in our stock is substantially lower, on average, than the total amount of shares owned by these shareholders. Any substantial trading activity executed by these large shareholders could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Company's stock which may impact our ability to raise capital through equity financing, which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.. Our operations and properties could be adversely affected in the event of a hurricane, earthquake, natural disaster, or other significant disruption. Our corporate headquarters and many of our properties are located in Florida, where major hurricanes have occurred. We have income properties in California where earthquakes have occurred. We have income properties in other states or regions that experience similar or other natural disasters. Depending on where. 24. Table of Contents. any hurricane makes landfall, our properties in Florida could experience significant damage. Similarly, should an earthquake occur in California, our properties there could incur significant damage. In addition, the occurrence and frequency of hurricanes in Florida could also negatively impact demand for our real estate assets because of consumer perceptions of hurricane risks. In addition to hurricanes, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida and other states, such as tornadoes, floods, fires, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts, and heat waves, could have an adverse effect on our ability to develop properties or realize income from our properties. If a hurricane, earthquake, natural disaster or other similar significant disruption occurs, we may experience disruptions to our operations and damage to our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, our financing condition, our results of operations, and our cash flows.. Uninsured losses may adversely affect the Company's ability to pay outstanding indebtedness. The Company's income-producing properties are generally covered by comprehensive liability, fire, and extended insurance coverage, typically paid by the tenant under the triple-net and double-net lease structure. The Company's golf operations and assets are similarly covered by the aforementioned insurance coverages. The Company believes that the insurance carried on our properties and golf assets is adequate and in accordance with industry standards. There are, however, types of losses (such as from hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other types of natural disasters, or wars, terrorism, or other acts of violence) which may be uninsurable or the cost of insuring against these losses may not be economically justifiable. If an uninsured loss occurs or a loss exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose both its invested capital and anticipated revenues from the property, thereby reducing the Company's cash flow, impairing the value of the income property or golf assets and adversely impacting the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which the Company operates and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows. Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may negatively affect the Company's operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks against businesses within the United States. These attacks may directly impact the Company's physical assets or business operations or the financial condition of its tenants, lenders or other institutions with which the Company has a relationship. The United States may be engaged in armed conflict, which could have an impact on these parties. The consequences of armed conflict are unpredictable, and the Company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business. More generally, the occurrence of any of these events or the threat of these events, could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets and economies. They also could result in, or cause an economic recession in the United States or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.. We are highly dependent on information systems and certain third-party technology service providers, and systems failures not related to cyber-attacks or similar external attacks could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our securities and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. Our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of our systems or our networks could cause delays or other problems in our operations and communications. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. In addition, much of our information technology infrastructure is or may be managed by third parties and as such we also face the risk of operational failure, termination, or capacity constraints by any of these third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities. It is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or disruption of our networks or systems or any failure to maintain performance, reliability and security of our technological infrastructure, but significant events impacting our systems or networks could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows and negatively affect the market price of our securities.. Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect the Company's business and disrupt operations. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence. Should any such cyber incidents or similar events occur, the Company's assets, particularly cash, could be lost and, as a result, the Company's ability to execute its business and strategy could be impaired, thereby adversely affecting its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. 25. Table of Contents. Land use and environmental regulations could restrict, make costlier, or otherwise adversely impact our business. We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to land use, and development and permitting, and environmental compliance obligations. Any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of significant financial penalties or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect present and future operations or our ability to sell land, and thereby, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer. Additionally, development moratoriums may be imposed due to, among other possibilities, inadequate traffic capacity provided by existing roadways. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year. If municipalities in which we own land take these or similar actions, acquirers of our land assets may experience delays, increasing costs, or limitations in the ability to operate in those municipalities, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. We may encounter environmental problems which require remediation or the incurrence of significant costs to resolve which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate or that we previously owned or operated, and may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances or incur costs or obligations associated with wetland areas on our land holdings. Any such liability may be imposed without regard to whether the Company's management had knowledge or were otherwise aware of the origination of the environmental or wetland issues or were responsible for their occurrence. The presence of environmental issues or the failure to remediate properly any such losses at any of our properties or on our land holdings may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties, or to borrow using those properties as collateral. The costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate. The costs or liabilities associated with resolving environmental or wetland issues could be significant.. The uses of any of our income properties prior to our acquisition, and the building materials used in the construction of the property are among the property-specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties. In general, before we acquire our income properties, independent environmental consultants are engaged to conduct Phase I environmental assessments, which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling.  Depending on the Phase I results, we may elect to obtain Phase II environmental assessments which do involve this type of sampling. There can be no assurance that environmental liabilities have not developed since these environmental assessments were performed or that future uses or conditions (including changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations) or new information about previously unidentified historical conditions will not result in the imposition of environmental liabilities.. If we are subject to any material costs or liabilities associated with environmental or wetland issues, our financial condition, results of operations and our cash flows could be adversely affected.. The Company's operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by climate change, including possible changes in weather patterns, weather-related events, government policy, laws, regulations, and economic conditions. In recent years, the assessment of the potential impact of climate change has begun to impact the activities of government authorities, the pattern of consumer behavior, and other areas that impact the business environment in the United States including, but not limited to, energy-efficiency measures, water use measures, and land-use practices. The promulgation of policies, laws or regulations relating to climate change by governmental authorities in the U.S. and the markets in which the Company owns real estate may require the Company to invest additional capital in our income properties. In addition, the impact of climate change on businesses to whom the Company seeks to lease its income properties, or that may acquire its available land, is not reasonably determinable at this time. While not generally known at this time, climate change may impact weather patterns or the occurrence of significant weather events which could impact economic activity or the value of real estate in specific markets in which the Company owns its assets. The occurrence of any of these events or conditions may adversely impact the Company's ability to lease its income properties or complete land transactions with potential buyers, which would adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons, compliance with which may be costly. Compliance with the ADA requirements could involve modifications to our income properties or golf operations. Other federal, state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our income properties or golf operations. Although we believe that our income properties and golf operation facilities are sufficiently in compliance with. 26. Table of Contents. current requirements, noncompliance with the ADA or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of governmental fines or in the award to private litigants of damages against us. Costs such as these, as well as the general costs of compliance with these laws or regulations, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.. Compliance with proposed and recently enacted changes in securities laws and regulations increases our costs. The Dodd-Frank Act contains many regulatory changes and calls for future rulemaking that may affect our business. The final and complete set of regulations promulgating the Dodd-Frank Act has not yet been published. We are evaluating, and will continue to evaluate, the potential impact of regulatory change under the Dodd-Frank Act and other changes in securities laws and regulations.. The market value of the Company's securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility. As with other publicly-traded securities, the market price of the Company's common stock and convertible notes depends on various factors, which may change from time to time and/or may be unrelated to the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows and such factors may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in the market price of the Company's securities. These factors include, but are likely not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGeneral economic and financial market conditions including a weak economic environment;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLevel and trend of interest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company's ability to access the capital markets to raise additional debt or equity capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in the Company's cash flows or results of operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe Company's financial condition and performance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket perception of the Company compared to other real estate companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMarket perception of the real estate sector compared to other investment sectors; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tVolume of average daily trading and the amount of the Company's shares available to be traded.. The Company's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and price of our securities. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") as amended or modified from time to time, requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to ensure that it can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting and therefore would likely not be in compliance with SOX. An effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for the Company to prepare and produce reliable financial reports and to maintain its qualification as a public company and are important in reducing the risk of financial fraud. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its business and operating results could be harmed, qualification as a public company listed on the NYSE American stock exchange, could be jeopardized, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, and the market price of the Company's securities could drop significantly.. The Company's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors. The Company has consistently paid a dividend since 1976. Payment of the Company's dividend depends upon the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  The Company's ability to continue to pay dividends may be adversely impacted if any of the events or conditions associated with the risks described in this section were to occur."
