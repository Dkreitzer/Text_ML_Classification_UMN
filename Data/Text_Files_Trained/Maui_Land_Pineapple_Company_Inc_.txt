[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business. They are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. In assessing these risks, investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the SEC.. Risks Related to our Business. Unstable macroeconomic market conditions could materially and adversely affect our operating results.. Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk to our business as consumers, tourists and real estate investors postpone or reduce spending in response to tighter credit markets, energy costs, negative financial news, reduced consumer confidence, and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our products and services. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, interest rates, labor costs, access to credit on reasonable terms, geopolitical issues, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and operating results.. In addition, in the event that current equity or credit market conditions deteriorate, or if our expenses increase unexpectedly, it may become necessary for us to raise additional capital in the form of a debt or equity financing, or a combination of the two. A downturn in industry, market or economic conditions could make debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and, in the case of an equity financing, more dilutive to our existing stockholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our current business strategy, as well as our financial performance and stock price.. 6. Table of Contents. Real estate investments are subject to numerous risks and we are negatively impacted by downturns in the real estate market.. We are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property because we develop and sell real property, primarily for residential use. The market for real estate on Maui and in Hawaii generally tends to be highly cyclical and is typically affected by numerous changes in local, national and worldwide conditions, especially economic conditions, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperiods of economic uncertainty and weakness in Hawaii and in the United States generally;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainties and changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies resulting from changes in the U.S. presidential administration and concerns surrounding ongoing developments in the European Union, the Middle East and Asia;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigh unemployment rates and low consumer confidence;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe general availability of mortgage financing, including the effect of more stringent lending standards for mortgages and perceived or actual changes in interest rates;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenergy costs, including fuel costs, which could impact the cost and desirability of traveling to Hawaii;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal, state and federal government regulation, including eminent domain laws, which may result in a taking for less compensation than what we believe our property is worth;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe popularity of Maui in particular and Hawaii in general as a vacation destination or second home market;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relationship of the dollar to foreign currencies;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax law changes, including limits on, or the elimination of, the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expenses, the application of the alternative minimum tax, real property taxes and employee relocation expenses; and/or. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacts of God, such as tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters.. Changes in any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business by causing a more significant general decline in the market for residential or luxury real estate, which, in turn, could adversely affect our development plans, revenues and profitability. During low periods of demand, real estate may remain on hand for much longer than expected or be sold at lower than expected returns, or even at a loss, which could impair our liquidity and ability to proceed with development projects and negatively affect our operating results. Sustained adverse changes to our development plans could result in impairment charges or write-offs of deferred development costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in the current economic environment, equity real estate investments may be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to adjust our portfolio of properties quickly in response to economic or other conditions.. Because we are located in Hawaii and therefore apart from the mainland United States, our financial results are more sensitive to certain economic factors, such as spending on tourism and increased fuel and travel costs, which may adversely impact and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our businesses are dependent on attracting visitors to the Kapalua Resort, to Maui, and to the State of Hawaii as a whole. Economic factors that affect the number of visitors, their length of stay or expenditure levels will affect our financial performance. Factors such as the continuing worldwide economic uncertainty and weakness, the level of unemployment in Hawaii and the mainland United States, natural disasters, substantial increases in the cost of energy, including fuel costs, and events in the airline industry that may reduce passenger capacity or increase traveling costs could reduce the number of visitors to the Kapalua Resort and negatively affect a potential buyer’s demand for our future property developments, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the threat, or perceived threat, of heightened terrorist activity in the United States or other geopolitical events, or the spread of contagious diseases could negatively affect a potential visitor’s choice of vacation destination or second home location and as a result, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 7. Table of Contents. We have previously been involved in joint ventures and may be subject to risks associated with future joint venture relationships.. We have previously been involved in partnerships, joint ventures and other joint business relationships, and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour actual or potential lack of voting control over the joint venture;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to maintain good relationships with our joint venture partners;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with ours, especially in light of economic uncertainty and weakness;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta venture partner may fail to fund its share of operations and development activities, or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to us; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel.. In connection with our joint venture projects, we may be asked to guarantee the joint venture’s obligations, or to indemnify third parties in connection with a joint venture’s contractual arrangements. If we were to become obligated under such arrangements or become subject to the risks associated with joint venture relationships, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. If we are unable to complete land development projects within forecasted time and budget expectations, if at all, our financial results may be negatively affected.. We intend to develop resort and other properties as suitable opportunities arise, taking into consideration the general economic climate. New project developments have a number of risks, including risks associated with:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treceipt of zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tearthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires or other natural disasters that could adversely impact a project;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdefects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tability to raise capital;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpact of governmental assessments such as park fees or affordable housing requirements;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or timing of completion; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential lack of adequate building/construction capacity for large development projects.. If any development project is not completed on time or within budget, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.. If we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs, or at all, our operating results would be adversely affected.. The financial performance of our Real Estate segment is dependent upon our success in obtaining land use entitlements for proposed development projects. Obtaining all of the necessary entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. In some situations, we may be unable to obtain the necessary entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development. Delays or failures to obtain these entitlements may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.. 8. Table of Contents. If we are unable to successfully compete with other developers of real estate in Maui, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.. Our real estate products face significant competition from other luxury resort real estate properties on Maui, and from other residential property in Hawaii and the mainland United States. In many cases, our competitors are larger than us and have greater access to capital. If we are unable to compete with these competitors, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.. We may be subject to certain environmental regulations under which we may have additional liability and experience additional costs for land development.. Various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regulate our properties and could make us liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in property we currently own or operate or that we previously owned or operated. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present, could jeopardize our ability to develop, use, sell or rent our real property or to borrow using our real property as collateral. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes, we could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility, even if we never owned or operated that facility. Certain laws, ordinances and regulations, particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands, coastal zones and threatened or endangered species, could limit our ability to develop, use, sell or rent our real property.. Changes in weather conditions or natural disasters could adversely impact and materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Natural disasters could damage our resort and real estate holdings, resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors may be affected differently by such changes in weather conditions or natural disasters depending on the location of their assets or operations.. Our insurance coverages may be inadequate to cover any losses we incur.. We maintain various insurance coverages for our business. We have engaged experts to assist us in the determination of our insurance policy terms, including coverage limits and deductibles, based on an evaluation of the level of potential risk, exposure and costs involved. This may result in insurance coverage that may not be sufficient to cover the full value of our losses in certain catastrophic or unforeseen circumstances. In addition, securing coverage in the event we file a claim under our insurance policies may involve substantial time, effort, resources and the risk that the insurance carrier may deny or dispute coverage under the policy. Under such circumstances, we may not receive insurance proceeds or the insurance proceeds we receive may not fully cover business interruptions or losses and our operating results, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.. Unauthorized use of our trademarks could negatively impact our businesses.. We have several trademarks that we have registered in the United States and in several foreign countries. To the extent that our exclusive use of these trademarks is challenged, we intend to vigorously defend our rights. If we are not successful in defending our rights, our businesses could be adversely impacted.. Failure to maintain the security of our internal and customer electronic information could adversely affect our operations, damage our business reputation and subject us to possible costs and legal action.. Our business relies on computers and digital technology to process a significant portion of our transactions and store our business records. In addition to internal employment and other sensitive data, we and our service providers also maintain certain digitally-stored information about our customers, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information. We, therefore, face risks associated with security breaches or disruptions including cyber-attacks, malware, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our networks and other cyber-related concerns.. 9. Table of Contents. The integrity and protection of our employee, customer and other company data are critical to us. Although we and our service providers make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our computer systems and networks, including implementation of various control and protection measures, there can be no assurance that our security efforts or measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will be avoided. Because of the dynamic and ever evolving nature of techniques utilized in attempted security breaches, it is impossible for us and our service providers to entirely mitigate this risk. We also cannot estimate or predict with any certainty the potential costs or consequences that may be involved in the event of a material cyber security breach or disruption. Our failure to maintain security over our data, including penetration of our network security and potential misappropriation of confidential and personal information could result in disruption to our operations, damage to our business reputation, possible costs and legal action.. Market volatility of asset values and interest rates affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.. We have two defined benefit pension plans which were frozen with respect to benefits and the addition of participants in 2011. The funded status and our ability to satisfy the future obligations of the plans are affected by, among other things, changes in interest rates, returns from plan asset investments, and actuarial assumptions including the life expectancies of the plans’ participants. If we are unable to adequately fund or meet our future obligations with respect to the plans, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. Changes in U.S. accounting standards may adversely impact us.. The regulatory boards and government agencies that determine financial accounting standards and disclosures in the U.S., including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) (collectively, the “Boards”) and the SEC, continually change and update the financial accounting standards we must follow.. In February 2016, the Boards issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU), which changes certain aspects of accounting for leases for both lessees and lessors. Since February 2016, several additional ASUs have been issued to clarify implementation issues. The final update is effective on January 1, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial condition or results of operations, which in turn could also significantly impact the market price of our common stock. Such potential impacts include, without limitation:. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant changes to our balance sheet relating to the recognition of operating leases as assets or liabilities based on existing lease terms and whether we are the lessor or lessee;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant changes in the timing of revenue recognition (related to lease arrangements in which we are the lessor) or expense recognition (related to the lease arrangements in which we are the lessee), stemming from the potential classification of financing or sales-type leases under the new ASU, for leases that are classified as operating leases under the current accounting standards; and. •  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSignificant fluctuations in our reported results of operations.. In addition, the new accounting update could make leasing/re-leasing of our space less attractive to our potential and current tenants, which could reduce overall occupancy of our properties. Under the current guidance, our tenants do not reflect operating leases with us as a liability on their balance sheets, but only provide a disclosure of future minimum payments associated with the operating lease in the footnotes to their financial statements. The new lease standard will require that lessees record on the balance sheets their rights and obligations pertaining to operating leases with a term of over 12 months. Changes in lease accounting standards could potentially impact the structure and terms of future leases since our tenants may seek to limit lease terms to avoid recognizing lease obligations in their financial statements. The new rules may also make lease renewal options less attractive because, under certain circumstances, the rules will require a tenant to assume that a renewal right will be exercised and accrue a liability relating to the longer lease term. Shorter lease terms and a reduction in rentable square feet leased may lead to reduction in occupancy rates and decline in rental revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU on recognition of revenue arising from contracts with customers and subsequently issued an ASU on recognition of gains and losses from the transfer of nonfinancial assets in contracts with noncustomers. The updates became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The core principle underlying the revenue recognition ASU is that an entity will recognize revenue to represent the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in such exchange. This will require entities to identify contractual performance obligations and determine whether revenue should be recognized at a point in time or over time, based on when control of goods and services transfers to a customer.. 10. Table of Contents. Any difficulties in the implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems and to update our policies, procedures, information systems, and internal controls over financial reporting, could result in materially inaccurate financial statements, which in turn could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. The adoption of new accounting standards could also affect the calculation of our credit facility covenants. We cannot be assured that we will be able to work with our lenders to amend our credit facility covenants in response to changes in accounting standards.. Risks Related to Indebtedness. We have entered into a credit agreement for a $15.0 million revolving line of credit facility with a bank. The credit facility has a maturity date of December 31, 2019 and its terms include certain financial and operating covenants, which if we fail to satisfy, could accelerate our repayment obligations and adversely affect our operations and financial results.. The terms of our credit facility includes covenants requiring among other things, a minimum of $1.5 million in liquidity (as defined), a maximum of $45.0 million in total liabilities and a limitation on new indebtedness. Our ability to continue to borrow under our credit facility to fund our business initiatives depends upon our ability to comply with these covenants.. Our business initiatives for the next twelve months include investing in our operating infrastructure and continued planning and entitlement efforts on our development projects. At times, this may require borrowing under our credit facility or other indebtedness, repayment of which may be dependent on selling of our real estate assets at acceptable prices in condensed timeframes.. Our indebtedness could have the effect of, among other things, increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds.. Risks Relating to our Stock. Our stock price has been subject to significant volatility.. In 2017, the low and high share prices of our common stock ranged from $6.95 to $27.80. Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant volatility. Among others, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in this annual report, the following factors, some of which are out of our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to continue to be volatile:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe relatively low volume of trading in our stock; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe lack of significant securities analysts coverage of our stock.. Fluctuations in the price of our common stock may also be exacerbated by economic and other conditions in Maui in particular, or conditions in the financial markets generally.. Share ownership by our affiliates make it more difficult for third parties to acquire us or effectuate a change of control that might be viewed favorably by other shareholders.. As of February 16, 2018, affiliates of our company owned, in the aggregate, approximately 65% of our outstanding shares. As a result, if these affiliates were to oppose a third party’s acquisition proposal for, or a change in control of, the Company, these affiliates may have sufficient voting power to be able to block or at least delay such an acquisition or change in control from taking place, even if other shareholders would support such a sale or change of control.. 11. Table of Contents. Trading in our stock over the last twelve months has been limited, so investors may not be able to sell as much stock as they want at prevailing prices.. The average daily trading volume in our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 65,000 shares. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Moreover, the market price for shares of our common stock may be made more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused by the trading in a relatively small number of shares. Volatility in our common stock could cause stockholders to incur substantial losses.. We do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.. We have not declared or paid regular cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. The payment of cash dividends by us is restricted by our credit facility which contains covenants prohibiting us from paying any cash dividends without the lender’s prior approval. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.. If we do not meet the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), our common stock may be delisted.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. If we are unable to maintain compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standards the NYSE may take action to delist our common stock. Delisting could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business. In addition, if our common stock is delisted, it would violate the covenants of our credit facility.. We may need additional funds which, if available, could result in significant dilution to our stockholders, have superior rights to our common stock and contain covenants that restrict our operations.. If unanticipated contingencies or other unforeseen circumstances arise, it may be necessary for us to raise additional capital either through public or private equity or debt financing. We cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to obtain the additional needed funds on reasonable terms, or at all. If we were to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into our common stock, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution. If we issued preferred equity or debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. If additional funds are raised through a bank credit facility or the issuance of debt securities, the holder of such indebtedness would have rights senior to the rights of equity holders and the terms of such indebtedness could impose restrictions on our operations."
