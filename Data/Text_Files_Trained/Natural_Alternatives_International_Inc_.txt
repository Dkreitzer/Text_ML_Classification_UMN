[1] "ITEM 1A.           RISK FACTORS. You should carefully review and consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this report and in other reports and documents we file with the SEC when evaluating our business and future prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional material risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also occur. If any of the following risks or any additional risks and uncertainties actually occur or become material, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or a portion of the value of your investment in our common stock. You should not draw any inference as to the magnitude of any particular risk from its position in the following discussion.. Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, our revenues would be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or a significant change in their business, personnel or the timing or amount of their orders.. We have in the past and expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of customers. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, sales to our largest customer, The Juice Plus+ Company, were approximately 56% of our consolidated net sales. We also have one other private-label contract manufacturing customer that represented 10% of our consolidated net sales. No other customers represented more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of one of these customers or other major customers, a significant decline in sales to any one of these customers, a significant change in their business personnel, or in any one of these customer’s ability to make payments when due, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the timing of our customers’ orders is impacted by, among other factors, their marketing programs, their customer demand, seasonality, their raw material suppliers we are sometimes required to use, their supply chain management, entry into new markets and their new product introductions, all of which are outside of our control. All of these attributes have had and are expected to have a significant impact on our business.. Our future growth and stability depends, in part, on our ability to diversify our sales. Our efforts to establish new sales from existing customers and new customers could require significant initial investments, which may or may not result in higher sales and improved financial results.. Our business strategy depends in large part on our ability to develop new product sales from current and new customer relationships. These activities often require a significant up-front investment including, among others, customized formulations, regulatory compliance, product registrations, package design, product testing, pilot production runs, and the build-up of initial inventory. We may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time we generate net sales from new products or customers, and it is possible after incurring such expenditures we may not generate material revenue from new products or customers. If we incur significant expenses and investments in inventory that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results would be adversely affected.. We currently derive significant revenues and income from sales of beta-alanine and licensing our patents. Our ability to maintain or grow our sales of beta-alanine and license revenue from our other patents is contingent on our ability to continue to defend our patents, and commercialize the sale of beta-alanine under our instant release CarnoSyn® patents and trademark and our sustained release Carnosyn® patents and trademark.. We own multiple patents and trademarks related to the use of beta-alanine in food and nutritional supplements. A majority of our revenue and income from this segment is currently derived from activity related to licensing our patents associated with instant release beta-alanine, sold under our trade name CarnoSyn®. Fifteen patents related to CarnoSyn® expired in August 2017 and we have four remaining patents for this version of CarnoSyn®, which begin to expire in August 2023. There is no assurance we will be successful maintaining our historical CarnoSyn® instant release beta-alanine sales levels or growing future sales volumes with our remaining CarnoSyn® instant release patent estate. If we are not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. We believe SR CarnoSyn® is a superior delivery system for CarnoSyn® beta-alanine based on its sustained release profile that allows for increased daily dosing and improved muscle retention of carnosine. Our patents related to SR CarnoSyn® extend through 2026 and we believe the introduction of SR CarnoSyn® beta-alanine is an important step in the further commercialization of our patent estate. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in getting the market to transition to this new form of beta-alanine or that we will be successful launching new products utilizing SR CarnoSyn® beta-alanine. If we are not successful in either one of these goals, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.. We have incurred, and may continue to incur significant costs defending our intellectual property. We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.. We possess and may possess in the future certain proprietary technology, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names, licenses, patents and similar intellectual property. We may continue to incur significant patent and trademark litigation costs associated with creating and defending our intellectual property. During fiscal 2018, we incurred approximately $2.9 million in patent litigation and prosecution expense and may incur significant similar expenses during fiscal 2019. These efforts are described in more detail under Item 3 of this report. There is no assurance we will be able to protect our intellectual property adequately or that our intellectual property rights will be upheld. If pending legal proceedings to invalidate our patent rights are successful, they could have a material adverse impact upon our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Additional litigation in the U.S. or abroad may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation, even if successful, could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If such infringement claims are asserted against us, we may seek to obtain a license under the third party’s intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance such a license would be available on terms acceptable or favorable to us, if at all.. Possible new tariffs on imported goods from China and elsewhere could adversely affect our business operations.. The President of the United States has recently ordered U.S. government agencies to consider new and increased tariffs on a wide range of goods and materials imported from China and other governments, in addition to the tariffs already imposed. These goods may include products and applications, including ingredients we or our customers require for their products. In addition these goods may include beta-alanine.  The commercialization of our beta-alanine patent estate depends on the availability of the raw material beta-alanine. In response, China and other governments announced plans to impose tariffs on certain American products if additional U.S. tariffs are imposed. The resulting tariffs could have a significant adverse effect on our customer’s businesses, the availability of beta-alanine, and the cost of our products. While it is too early to predict how the additional potential U.S. tariffs will be imposed, or how any tariffs will impact our business, we believe the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. or other governments on products or ingredients we use in the products we manufacture could adversely impact our customers as a result of increased product costs, and such tariffs could have an adverse impact on the availability of beta-alanine and the licensing of our patents and trademarks and our distribution of this raw material.. If so, this could adversely impact our ability to license our patents and trademarks, our ability to sell beta-alanine, and our customers’ ability to compete in the market place, reducing demand for our products, and products we manufacture for them. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. 7. Table of Contents. Our operating results will vary. We experienced declines in net sales and incurred losses in past years and there is no guarantee our sales will improve or we will earn a profit in future years. Fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock.. Our net sales increased during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, but there can be no assurance our net sales will continue to improve in the near term, or we will earn a profit in any given year. We have experienced net losses in the past and may incur losses in the future. Our operating results may fluctuate from year to year and/or from quarter to quarter due to various factors including differences related to the timing of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes and other factors described in this report. At times, these fluctuations may be significant. We anticipate generating positive net income in fiscal 2019, although there is no assurance we will be able to do so. Fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect the share price of our common stock.. Our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive government regulation, which could limit or prevent the sale of our products in some markets and could increase our costs.. The manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous national and local governmental agencies in the U.S. and in other countries. For example, we are required to comply with certain GMP and incur costs associated with the audit and certification of our facilities. Failure to comply with governmental regulations may result in, among other things, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, product seizures, fines, and criminal prosecutions. Any action of this type by a governmental agency could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products and services. In addition, if such governmental agency has reason to believe the law is being violated (for example, if it believes we do not possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. Governmental agency enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action by a governmental agency could materially adversely affect our ability and our customers’ ability to successfully market and continue selling the products involved.. Before commencing operations of marketing our products in markets outside the U.S., we may be required to obtain approvals, licenses, or certifications from a country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Approvals or licensing may be conditioned on reformulation of products or even may be unavailable with respect to certain products or product ingredients. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Furthermore, the regulations of these countries may conflict with those in the U.S. and with each other. The sale of our products in certain European countries is subject to the rules and regulations of the European Union, which may be interpreted differently among the countries within the European Union. The cost of complying with these various and potentially conflicting regulations can be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations.. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations, when and if adopted, would have on our business. They could include requirements for the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional compliance costs or record keeping requirements, expanded or different labeling, and additional scientific substantiation. Any or all of these requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations.. A significant or prolonged economic downturn, could have, and at certain times in the past has had, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.. Our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers and licensees, which in turn is affected by the level of consumer demand for their products. A significant or prolonged economic downturn may adversely affect the disposable income of many consumers and may lower demand for the products we produce for our private-label contract manufacturing customers and products sold or manufactured by others using our licensed patent rights. Any decline in economic conditions in the U.S. and the various foreign markets in which our customers operate could negatively impact our customers’ businesses and our operations. A significant enough decline in consumer demand and the level of business activity of our customers due even if only due in part to general economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins.. The failure of our suppliers to supply quality materials in sufficient quantities, at a favorable price, and in a timely fashion could adversely affect the results of our operations.. We buy our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers. During fiscal 2018, two of our suppliers, Van Drunen Farms and Capsugel, each represented more than 10% of our total raw material purchases. During fiscal 2017, one of our suppliers, Scientific Living, represented more than 10% of our raw material purchases. The loss of any of our major suppliers or of any supplier who provides us hard to obtain materials could adversely affect our business operations. Although we believe we could establish alternate sources for most of our raw materials, any delay in locating and establishing relationships with other sources could result in shortages of products we manufacture from such raw materials, with a resulting loss of sales and customers. In certain situations we may be required to alter our products or with our customer’s consent to substitute different materials from alternative sources.. A shortage of raw materials or an unexpected interruption of supply thereof could also result in higher prices for those materials. We have experienced increases in various raw material costs, transportation costs and the cost of petroleum-based raw materials and packaging supplies used in our business. Increasing raw material and product cost pricing pressures have continued throughout fiscal 2018 as a result of limited supplies of various ingredients and the effects of higher labor and transportation costs. We expect these upward pressures to continue through fiscal 2019. Although we may be able to raise our prices in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we may not be able to raise prices sufficiently or quickly enough to offset the negative effects such cost increases could have on our results of operations or financial condition.. There can be no assurance suppliers will provide the quality raw materials needed by us in the quantities requested or at a price we are willing to pay. Because we do not control the actual production of these raw materials, we are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production of materials including those resulting from conditions outside of our control, such as weather, transportation interruptions, strikes, terrorism, natural disasters, and other catastrophic events.. In addition, our efforts to commercialize our patent estate and the revenues we receive from related supply agreements are substantially dependent on the availability of the raw material beta-alanine and sales of beta-alanine or products incorporating beta-alanine. The availability of beta-alanine, and thus sales of such raw material and products using such material, could be negatively impacted by any shortages, interruptions and similar events described above, which could in turn adversely affect the amount of revenue and product margin we earn from the sale of beta-alanine.  Additional tariffs imposed by any government on beta-alanine could have an adverse impact on the price we have to pay for beta-alanine and the availability of beta-alanine.. Our industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively. Increased competition could adversely affect our financial condition.. The market for our products, and those of our customers, is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and broader name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to research and development, marketing and other activities that could provide them with a competitive advantage. Our market has relatively low entry barriers and is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products that may rapidly capture significant market share. Our competitors may not stress the level of quality we provide and could manufacture at lower costs. Our competitors are largely private and not subject to the same disclosure requirements as a publicly traded company. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in this intensely competitive environment.. 8. Table of Contents. We could be exposed to product liability claims or other litigation, which may be costly and could materially adversely affect our operations.. We could face financial liability due to product liability claims if the use of our products results in significant loss or injury. Additionally, the manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of injury to consumers from tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination. We could be exposed to future product liability claims that, among others: our products contain contaminants; we provide consumers with inadequate instructions about product use; or we provide inadequate warning about side effects or interactions of our products with other substances. Even if we were to prevail in any such claims, the cost of litigation and settlement could be significant.. We maintain product liability insurance coverage, including primary product liability and excess liability coverage. The cost of this coverage has increased dramatically in recent years, while the availability of adequate insurance coverage has decreased. While we expect to be able to continue our product liability insurance, there can be no assurance we will in fact be able to continue such insurance coverage, or that our insurance will be adequate to cover any liability we may incur, or our insurance will continue to be available at an economically reasonable cost.. Additionally, it is possible one or more of our insurers could exclude from our coverage certain ingredients used in our products. In such event, we may have to stop using those ingredients or rely on indemnification or similar arrangements with our customers who wish to continue to include those ingredients in their products. A substantial increase in our product liability risk or the loss of customers or product lines, or the failure of a customer to honor indemnification agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. If we or our private-label contract manufacturing customers expand into additional markets outside the U.S. or our or their sales in markets outside the U.S. increase, our business could become increasingly subject to political, economic, regulatory and other risks in those markets, which could adversely affect our business.. Our future growth may depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our private-label contract manufacturing customers to expand into additional markets outside the U.S. or to improve sales in markets outside the U.S. There can be no assurance we or our customers will be able to expand in existing markets outside the U.S. or enter new markets on a timely basis, or that new markets outside the U.S. will be profitable. There are significant regulatory and legal barriers in markets outside the U.S. that must be overcome to operate in such markets. We will be subject to the burden of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws, including multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting laws. We also may experience difficulties adapting to new cultures, business customs and legal systems. Our sales and operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and social uncertainties including, among others:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges and limits in import and export controls;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in custom duties and tariffs;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government regulations and laws;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcoordination of geographically separated locations;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tabsence in some jurisdictions of effective laws to protect our intellectual property rights;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in currency exchange rates;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic and political instability; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency transfer and other restrictions and regulations that may limit our ability to sell certain products or repatriate profits to the U.S.. Any changes related to these and other factors could adversely affect our business, profitability and growth prospects. If we or our customers expand into additional markets outside the U.S. or improve sales in markets outside the U.S., these and other risks associated with operations outside the U.S. may increase.. Our business is subject to the effects of adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our sales and revenues.. Our business can be affected by adverse publicity or negative public perception about our competitors, our customers, our products, or our industry generally. Adverse publicity may include publicity about the nutritional supplements industry generally, the efficacy, safety and quality of nutritional supplements and other health care products or ingredients in general or our products or ingredients specifically, and regulatory investigations, regardless of whether these investigations involve us or the business practices or products of our competitors, or our customers. Any adverse publicity or negative public perception could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies are alleged to be or are proved to be harmful to consumers or to have unanticipated and unwanted health consequences.. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel, our business may suffer.. Our executive officers and other management personnel are primarily responsible for our day-to-day operations. We believe our success depends largely on our ability to attract, maintain and motivate highly qualified management personnel. Competition for qualified individuals can be intense and has been increasing in recent years, and we may not be able to hire additional qualified personnel in a timely manner or on terms that would not substantially increase our costs. Any inability to retain a skilled professional management team could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our goals.. Our manufacturing and third party fulfillment activities are subject to certain risks.. We manufacture the majority of our products at our manufacturing facilities in California and Switzerland. As a result, we are dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. Our manufacturing operations, including those of our suppliers, are subject to power failures, blackouts, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, human error, breakdown, failure or substandard performance of our facilities, our equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, terrorism, natural or other disasters, intentional acts of violence, and the need to comply with the requirements or directives of governmental agencies, including the FDA. In addition, we may in the future determine to expand or relocate our facilities, which may result in slowdowns or delays in our operations. While we have implemented and regularly evaluate various emergency, contingency and disaster recovery plans and we maintain business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our facilities in California or Switzerland would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance our contingency plans will prove to be adequate or successful if needed or our insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or, if available, will be adequate to cover any losses that we may incur from an interruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations.. We outsource our beta-alanine fulfillment and distribution activities and certain contract manufacturing activities. The operation of the third party service provider’s facilities is subject to the interruption and similar risks described above for our facilities and there can be no assurance these interruptions or any other operational problem at such third party’s facilities would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 9. Table of Contents. We may pursue acquisitions of other companies that, if not successful, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may pursue acquisitions of companies we believe could complement or expand our business, augment our market coverage, provide us with important relationships or otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential difficulties related to integrating the products, personnel and operations of the acquired company;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to operate efficiently as a combined organization utilizing common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resources practices;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiverting management’s attention from the other daily operations of the business;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tentering markets in which we have no or limited prior direct experience and where competitors in such markets have more experience and stronger market positions;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential inability to achieve cost savings and other potential benefits expected from the acquisition;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential impairment charges, which may be significant, against goodwill and purchased intangible assets acquired in the acquisition due to changes in conditions and circumstances that occur after the acquisition, many of which may be outside of our control.. There can be no assurance that acquisitions we may pursue will be successful. If we pursue an acquisition but are not successful in completing it, or if we complete an acquisition but are not successful in integrating the acquired company’s employees, products or operations successfully, our business, financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected.. Collectively, our officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock, giving them influence over corporate transactions and other matters and potentially limiting the influence of other stockholders on important policy and management issues.. Our officers and directors, together with their families and affiliates, beneficially owned approximately 28% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of June 30, 2018. Approximately 15% of the outstanding shares of common stock are beneficially owned by Mark LeDoux, and his family and affiliates. Mr. LeDoux is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. As a result, our officers and directors, and in particular Mr. LeDoux, could influence such business matters as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions.. Various transactions could be delayed, deferred, or prevented without the approval of stockholders, including the following:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransactions resulting in a change in control;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmergers and acquisitions;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttender offers;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\telection of directors; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproxy contests.. There can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to the officers and directors who own shares of our common stock or that conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to us or our other stockholders.. We may not be able to raise additional capital or obtain additional financing if needed.. It is possible our cash from operations could become insufficient to meet our working capital needs and/or to implement our business strategies. In such an event, there can be no assurance our existing line of credit would be sufficient to meet our working capital needs. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain certain loan covenants, we may no longer have access to our credit line. Under the terms of our credit facility, there are limits on our ability to create, incur or assume additional indebtedness without the approval of our lender. Our credit line terminates in February 2021 and there is no guarantee we will be able to extend or renew this credit line on favorable terms or at all.. We may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses and potentially lower our credit ratings. At any given time, it could be difficult for us to raise capital due to a variety of factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including a tightening of credit markets, overall poor performance of stock markets, and/or an economic slowdown in the U.S. or other countries, or in the businesses of our customers. There is no assurance we would be able to market such security issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, if we did not have any alternate funds we might not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or meet unanticipated customer requirements.. Our inability to raise additional capital or to obtain additional financing if needed could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategies and meet our goals. This, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. If certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law are triggered, the market for our shares may decrease.. Certain provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware corporate law may discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire our business, even if such proposals would benefit our stockholders. Those provisions include one that authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock having such rights, preferences, and privileges, including voting rights, as the Board of Directors designates. The rights of our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Any or all of these provisions could delay, deter or prevent a takeover of our company and could lower the price investors are willing to pay for our common stock and the number of investors willing to own our common stock.. 10. Table of Contents. Our stock price could fluctuate significantly.. Stock prices in general can be volatile and ours is no different. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate in response to the following, as well as other, factors:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbroad market fluctuations and general economic and/or political conditions;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our financial results;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelatively low trading volumes;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture offerings of our common stock or other securities;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe general condition of the nutritional supplement industry;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased competition;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregulatory action;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse publicity;. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmanipulative or illegal trading practices by third parties; and. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour and our customer’s and supplier’s product and other public announcements.. The stock market has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. There can be no assurance that an active market in our stock will continue to exist or that the price of our common stock will not decline. Our future operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this were to occur, the price of our common stock could decline, perhaps substantially.. From time to time our shares may be listed for trading on one or more foreign exchanges, with or without our prior knowledge or consent. Certain foreign exchanges may have less stringent listing requirements, rules and enforcement procedures than the Nasdaq Global Market or other markets in the U.S., which may increase the potential for manipulative trading practices to occur on such foreign exchanges. These practices, or the perception by investors that such practices could occur, may increase the volatility of our stock price or result in a decline in our stock price, which in some cases could be significant."
