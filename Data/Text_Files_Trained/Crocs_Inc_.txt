[1] "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. The reader should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information presented within this report. The risks set forth below are those that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. These risks have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, or access to sources of financing. The risks included here are not exhaustive and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. Since we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business. You should carefully consider each of the following risks described below in conjunction with all other information presented in this report.. Risks Specific to Our Company. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brand and failure to strengthen and preserve this value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.. We believe much of our success has been attributable to the strength of the Crocs global brand. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S., where the Crocs global brand is less well-known and perceived differently, we believe we must timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand and leverage the value of our brand across all sales channels. We may have difficulty managing our brand image across markets and international borders as certain consumers may perceive our brand image to be out of style, outdated, or otherwise undesirable. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. In the past, several footwear companies including ours have experienced periods of rapid growth in revenues and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses, and our business may be similarly affected in the future. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could also diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, fail to comply with laws and regulations, or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets. Business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as perceived product safety issues, whether isolated or recurring, in particular incidents that receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, counterfeit reproductions of our products or other infringement of our intellectual property rights, including unauthorized uses of our trademarks by third parties, could harm our brand and adversely impact our business.. We may be unable to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy, maintain or grow our current revenue and profit levels, or accurately forecast geographic demand and supply for our products.. Our ability to maintain our revenue and profit levels or to grow in the future depends on, among other things, the continued success of our efforts to maintain our brand image, our ability to bring compelling and profit enhancing footwear offerings to market, our ability to effectively manage or reduce expenses and our ability to expand within our current distribution channels and increase sales of our products into new locations internationally. Successfully executing our long-term growth and profitability strategy will depend on many factors, including our ability to:. • Strengthen our brand globally;. • Focus on relevant geographies and markets, product innovation and profitable new growth platforms while maintaining demand for our current offerings;. • Effectively manage our company-operated retail stores (including closures of existing stores) while meeting operational and financial targets at the retail store level;. • Successfully implement our previously identified $75 to $85 million annual selling, general and administrative reduction plan;. • Accurately forecast the global demand for our products and the timely execution of supply chain strategies to deliver product around the globe efficiently based on that demand;. • Use and protect the Crocs brand and our other intellectual property in new markets and territories;. • Achieve and maintain a strong competitive position in new and existing markets;. • Attract and retain qualified wholesalers and distributors;. • Consolidate our distribution and supply chain network to leverage resources and simplify our fulfillment process; and. 9. Table of Contents. • Execute multi-channel advertising and marketing campaigns to effectively communicate our message directly to our consumers and employees.. If we are unable to successfully implement any of the above mentioned strategies and the many other factors mentioned throughout these risk factors, our business may fail to grow, our brand may suffer, and our business and financial results may be adversely impacted.. There can be no assurance that the strategic plans we have begun to implement will be successful.. We believe our strategic initiatives will better position Crocs to adapt to changing consumer demands and global economic developments. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining the product portfolio and reducing non-core product development, we believe we will create a more powerful consumer connection to the brand.. We are refining our business model around the world by prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, moving away from direct investment in the retail and wholesale businesses in smaller markets, and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors in smaller markets and in markets where local expertise is advantageous. Further, we intend to expand our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement and enhance brand reputation.. In 2017 we identified annual reductions in SG&A in the amount of $75 to $85 million which, once implemented, are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019, compared to 2016. We achieved approximately $23 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017 while incurring approximately $10 million of costs to re-set our variable compensation. We remain on track to achieve the targeted SG&A reductions by 2019. We incurred $11 million in non-recurring charges to achieve these SG&A reductions in 2017 and expect to incur approximately $5 million in non-recurring charges in 2018, for a total of $16 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan. We reduced our company-operated retail stores in 2017 by 111 and anticipate an additional reduction of approximately 50 company-operated retail stores in 2018, thereby reducing our total store count to approximately 400 from 558 over a two year period. The majority of company-operated store closures are occurring as store leases expire.. While these strategic plans, along with other steps to be taken, are intended to improve and grow our business, there can be no assurance that this will be the case, or that additional steps or accrual of additional material expenses or accounting charges will not be required. If additional steps are required, there can be no assurance that they will be properly implemented or will be successful.. If our online e-commerce sites do not function effectively, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.. An increasing amount of our products are sold on our e-commerce sites as well as third-party e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part or third-parties to provide effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of our merchandise could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of sales, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our e-commerce business may be particularly vulnerable to cyber threats including denial of service attacks. Sales in our e-commerce channel may also divert sales from our retail and wholesale channels.. We face significant competition.. The footwear industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include most major athletic and non-athletic footwear companies and retailers with their own private label footwear products. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than us, more comprehensive product lines, a broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, a longer operating history, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and spend substantially more than we do on product marketing. Our competitors' greater financial resources and capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry and general economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, launch more extensive or diverse product lines and more quickly develop new products. Continued demand in the market for casual footwear and readily available offshore manufacturing capacity has also encouraged the entry of new competitors into the marketplace and has increased competition from established companies. Some of our competitors are offering products that are substantially similar, in design and materials, to our products. If we are unable to compete successfully in the future, our sales and profits may decline, we may lose market share, our business and financial results may deteriorate, and the market price of our common stock would likely fall.. 10. Table of Contents. Refining our footwear product line may be difficult and expensive. If we are unable to do so successfully, our brand may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain or grow our current revenue and profit levels.. To successfully refine our footwear product line, we must anticipate, understand, and react to the rapidly changing tastes of consumers and provide appealing merchandise in a timely manner. New footwear models that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or our brand may fall out of favor with consumers. If we are unable to anticipate, identify, or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, our revenues may decrease, our brand image may suffer, our operating performance may decline, and we may not be able to execute our growth plans.. In producing new footwear models, we may encounter difficulties that we did not anticipate during the product development stage. Our development schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change in response to consumer preferences and competing products. If we are not able to efficiently manufacture new products in quantities sufficient to support wholesale, retail, and e-commerce distribution, we may not be able to recover our investment in the development of new styles and product lines and we would continue to be subject to the risks inherent to having a limited product line. Even if we develop and manufacture new footwear products that consumers find appealing, the ultimate success of a new style may depend on our pricing. We have a limited history of introducing new products in certain target markets; as such, we may introduce products that are not popular, set the prices of new styles too high for the market to bear, or we may not provide the appropriate level of marketing in order to educate the market and potential consumers about our new products. Achieving market acceptance will require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts, which could result in a material increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts effectively or that such efforts will be successful. Failure to gain market acceptance for new products could impede our ability to maintain or grow current revenue levels, reduce profits, adversely affect the image of our brands, erode our competitive position and result in long-term harm to our business and financial results.. If we do not accurately forecast consumer demand, we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers' orders, either of which could adversely affect our business.. The footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations, consolidation, contraction and closings, as well as fashion trends, rapid changes in consumer preferences, the effects of weather, general economic conditions and other factors affecting consumer demand. In addition, sales to our wholesale customers are generally subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer. These factors make it difficult to forecast consumer demand. If we overestimate demand for our products, we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at discounted prices resulting in lower gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, we could have inventory shortages which can result in lower sales, delays in shipments to customers, expedited shipping costs, and adversely affect our relationships with our customers and diminish brand loyalty. A decline in demand for our products, or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products, could adversely affect our business and financial results.. Our financial success may be limited to the strength of our relationships with and the success of our wholesale and distributor customers.. Our financial success is related to the willingness of our current and prospective wholesale and distributors customers to carry our products. We do not have long-term contracts and sales to our wholesalers and distributors are generally on an order-by-order basis and subject to cancellation and rescheduling. If we cannot fill orders in a timely manner, the sales of our products and our relationships may suffer. Alternatively, if our wholesalers or distributors experience diminished liquidity or other financial issues, we may experience a reduction in product orders, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms which could lead to larger outstanding balances, delays in collections of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increases in bad debt expenses and reduced cash flows if our collection efforts are unsuccessful. For example, we recorded an increase in allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in 2015, primarily as a result of delayed payments and payment defaults from certain distributor partners in China. Future problems with customers may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to grow our product line.. Changes in foreign exchange rates, most significantly but not limited to the Singapore Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Korean Won, and the Euro could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.. As a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (\"USD\"). We pay the majority of our third-party manufacturers, located primarily in Vietnam and China, in USD. Our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the USD value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by changes in exchange rates. A decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the USD could result in lower revenues, product price pressures, and increased losses from currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange rate volatility could also disrupt the business of the third-party manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to. 11. Table of Contents. finance. In 2017, we experienced a decrease of approximately $1.2 million in our Asia Pacific segment revenues as a result of increases in the value of Asian currencies relative to the USD, and an increase of approximately $4.4 million in our Europe revenues as a result of increases in the Euro and Russian Ruble relative to the USD. Strengthening of the USD against Asian and European currencies, and various other global currencies would adversely impact our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation. While we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities, the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy and as a result our forward contracts may not prove effective in reducing our exposures.. We conduct significant business activity outside the U.S. which exposes us to risks of international commerce.. A significant portion of our revenues is generated from foreign sales. Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations as well as the difficulties associated with promoting products in unfamiliar cultures. In addition to foreign manufacturing, we operate retail stores and sell our products to retailers outside of the U.S. Foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks including: tariffs, anti-dumping fines, import and export controls, and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules; delays associated with the manufacture, transportation and delivery of products; increased transportation costs due to distance, energy prices, or other factors; delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns; restrictions on the transfer of funds; restrictions, due to privacy laws, on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information; changes in governmental policies and regulations; political unrest, changes in law, terrorism, or war, any of which can interrupt commerce; potential violations of U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws by our employees, business partners or agents, despite our policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws; expropriation and nationalization; difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the U.S.; difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions; longer accounts receivable payment terms and difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivables; difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; greater risk that our business partners do not comply with our policies and procedures relating to labor, health and safety; and increased accounting and internal control costs. In addition, we are subject to customs laws and regulations with respect to our export and import activity which are complex and vary within legal jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot assure that there will be not be a control failure around customs enforcement despite the precautions we take. We are currently subject to audits by customs authorities. Any failure to comply with customs laws and regulations could be discovered during a U.S. or foreign government customs audit, or customs authorities may disagree with our tariff treatments, and such actions could result in substantial fines and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, changes to U.S. trade laws may adversely impact our operations. For example, the European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation, or similar evolving privacy laws in other jurisdictions, may harm or alter the operations of our e-commerce business, add additional compliance costs and obligations and subject us to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Compliance with these and other foreign legal regimes may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.. In addition, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative effect on our brands and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.. Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may adversely affect consumer spending and the financial health of our customers and others with whom we do business, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash resources.. Uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause consumers and retailers to defer purchases or cancel purchase orders for our products in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability, and weakened consumer confidence. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both globally and in specific markets, that may adversely affect the demand for our products including recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, or other economic factors. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time, the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results:. 12. Table of Contents. • Changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the USD could have a material impact on our reported financial results.. • Slower consumer spending may result in our inability to maintain or increase our sales to new and existing customers, cause reduced product orders or product order cancellations from wholesale accounts that are directly impacted by fluctuations in the broader economy, difficulties managing inventories, higher discounts, and lower product margins.. • If consumer demand for our products declines, we may not be able to profitably establish new retail stores, or continue to operate existing stores, due to higher fixed costs of the retail business.. • A decrease in credit available to our wholesale or distributor customers, product suppliers and other service providers, or financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facility or derivative instruments may result in credit pressures other financial difficulties or insolvency for these parties, with a potential adverse impact on our ability to obtain future financing, our business and our financial results.. • If our wholesale customers experience diminished liquidity, we may experience a reduction in product orders, an increase in customer order cancellations, and/or the need to extend customer payment terms which could lead to larger balances and delayed collection of our accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expenses for collection efforts, and increased risk of nonpayment by our wholesalers.. • If our manufacturers or other parties in our supply chain experience diminished liquidity, and as a result are unable to fulfill their obligations to us, we may be unable to provide our customers with our products in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales opportunities or a deterioration in our customer relationships.. Opening company-operated global retail stores incurs substantial fixed costs. If we are unable to generate sales, operate our retail stores profitably or otherwise fail to meet expectations, we may be unable to reduce such fixed costs and avoid losses or negative cash flows.. Opening and operating company-operated retail stores requires substantial financial commitments, including fixed costs, and are subject to numerous risks including consumer preferences, location and other factors that we do not control. Declines in revenue and operating performance of our company-operated retail stores could cause us to record impairment charges and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. During 2017, we opened, closed, and operated 19, 130, and 447 retail stores, respectively.. Although our strategic plan initiatives include a net reduction in our retail sales channel, we intend to continue to open new retail locations globally. Our ability to open new stores, including kiosks and store-in-store locations, successfully depends on our ability to identify suitable store locations, negotiate acceptable lease terms, hire, train, and retain store personnel and satisfy the fashion preferences in new geographic areas. Many of our company-operated retail stores are located in shopping malls and outlet malls and our success depends in part on obtaining prominent locations and the overall ability of the malls to successfully generate and maintain customer traffic. We cannot control the success of individual malls or store closures by other retailers, which may lead to mall vacancies and reduced customer foot traffic. In addition, consumer spending and shopping preferences have shifted, and may continue to further shift, away from brick and mortar retail to e-commerce channels, which may contribute to declining foot traffic in company-operated retail locations. Continued reduced customer foot traffic could reduce sales at our company-operated retail stores or hinder our ability to open retail stores in new markets, which could in turn negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, some of our company-operated retail stores occupy street locations that are heavily dependent on customer traffic generated by tourism. Any substantial decrease in tourism resulting from an economic slowdown, political, terrorism, social or military events or otherwise, is likely to adversely affect sales in our existing stores.. We may be required to record impairments of long-lived assets or incur other charges relating to our company-operated retail operations.. Impairment testing of our retail stores' long-lived assets requires us to make estimates about our future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic conditions, our results of operations, and competitive conditions in the industry. Due to the fixed-cost structure associated with our retail operations, negative cash flows or the closure of a store could result in impairment of leasehold improvements, impairment of other long-lived assets, write-downs of inventory, severance costs, significant lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. For example, during 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded impairments of which $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $9.6 million, respectively, related to our retail stores. These impairment charges may increase as we continue to evaluate our retail operations. The recording of additional impairments in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.. 13. Table of Contents. We depend heavily on third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S.. Third-party manufacturers located in Vietnam and China produced the majority of our footwear products in 2017 and are expected to do so in 2018. We depend on the ability of these manufacturers to finance the production of goods ordered, maintain adequate manufacturing capacity and meet our quality standards. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our third-party manufacturers, and we do not exert direct control over the manufacturers' operations. As such, from time to time we have experienced delays or inabilities to fulfill customer demand and orders. We cannot guarantee that any third-party manufacturer will have sufficient production capacity, meet our production deadlines or meet our quality standards.. Foreign manufacturing is subject to additional risks, including transportation delays and interruptions, work stoppages, political instability, expropriation, nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, changes in governmental policies and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls, and other barriers. We may not be able to offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in our internal manufacturing facilities due to capacity constraints, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative third-party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices. Any disruption in the supply of products from our third-party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, more expensive transportation methods, such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs. Increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our product margins.. In addition, because our footwear products are manufactured outside the U.S., the possibility of adverse changes in trade or political relations between the U.S. and other countries, political instability, increases in labor costs, changes in international trade agreements and tariffs, or adverse weather conditions could significantly interfere with the production and shipment of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. For example, the Trump Administration has suggested modifying existing trade agreements and/or imposing tariffs on foreign products. Changes in existing trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), or the imposition of tariffs on our products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.. We manufacture a portion of our products which causes us to incur greater fixed costs. Any difficulties or disruptions in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.. We produce a portion of our footwear products at company-operated manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Italy. There are significant fixed costs associated with the ownership and operations of these facilities and, as a result, efficient production of a sufficient volume of products is necessary to enable recovery of these costs. In addition, the manufacture of our products from the CrosliteTM material requires the use of a complex process and we may experience difficulty in producing footwear that meets our high quality control standards. We absorb the manufacturing and disposal costs of products that do not meet our quality standards. Further, significant excess capacity at any of our manufacturing facilities as a result of increased efficiencies in our supply chain process or continued volume declines, could result in under-utilization of our facilities, which could lead to excess fixed overhead costs per unit and reduced product margins. Any increases in our manufacturing costs, lack of operating efficiency or product quality could adversely impact our product margins. Furthermore, our manufacturing capabilities are subject to many of the same risks and challenges faced by our third-party manufacturers, including our ability to scale our production capabilities to meet the needs of our customers. Our manufacturing may also be disrupted for reasons beyond our control, including work stoppages, fires, earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters. Any disruption to our manufacturing operations will hinder our ability to deliver products to our customers in a timely manner and could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial results.. Our third-party manufacturing operations must comply with labor, trade and other laws; failure to do so may adversely affect us.. We require our third-party manufacturers to meet our quality control standards and footwear industry standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor, environmental, and other laws; however, we do not control our third-party manufacturers or their respective labor practices. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to quality standards or labor, environmental and other laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, generate negative publicity, damage our reputation and the value of our brand, and discourage customers from buying our products. We also require our third-party manufacturers to meet certain product safety standards. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to such product safety standards could lead to a product recall which could result in critical media coverage and harm our business, brand and reputation and cause us to incur additional costs.. 14. Table of Contents. In addition, if we or our third-party manufacturers violate U.S. or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, quota category, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, and fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. or foreign customs quotas, duties, taxes other charges, or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could have on our business, or results.. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials, and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs.. We depend on a limited number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear. We source the elastomer resins that constitute the primary raw materials used in compounding our CrosliteTM products, which we use to produce our various footwear products, from multiple suppliers. If the suppliers we rely on for elastomer resins were to cease production of these materials, we may not be able to obtain suitable substitute materials in time to avoid interruption of our production schedules. We are also subject to market issues related to supply and demand for our raw materials. We may have to pay substantially higher prices in the future for the elastomer resins or any substitute materials we use, which would increase our production costs and could have an adverse impact on our product margins. If we are unable to obtain suitable elastomer resins or if we are unable to procure sufficient quantities of the CrosliteTM material, we may not be able to meet our production requirements in a timely manner or may need to modify our product characteristics, which could result in less favorable market acceptance, lost potential sales, delays in shipments to customers, strained relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty.. Failure to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and counterfeiting of our brands could divert sales, damage our brand image and adversely affect our business.. We utilize trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, issued and pending patents and trade dress, and designs on nearly all of our products. We believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable trademarks and intellectual property is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. The laws of some countries, for example, China, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. We frequently discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging another party's products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement, particularly in some foreign countries, or if we are required to change our name or use a different logo, or it is otherwise found that we infringe on others intellectual property rights, continued sales of such competing products by third parties could harm our brand or we may be forced to cease selling certain products, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, revenues, and results of operations by resulting in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. If our brands are associated with inferior counterfeit reproductions, the integrity and reputation of our brands could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are typically met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.. We also rely on trade secrets, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary rights and information related to, among other things, the CrosliteTM material and product development, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Using third-party manufacturers and compounding facilities may increase the risk of misappropriation of our trade secrets, confidential information and other unpatented proprietary information. The agreements we use in an effort to protect our intellectual property, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary information may be ineffective or insufficient to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and information. A party to one of these agreements may breach the agreement and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. As a result, our trade secrets, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary rights and information may become known to others, including our competitors. Furthermore, our competitors or others may independently develop or discover such trade secrets and information, which would render them less valuable to us.. Our quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to fluctuation as a result of a variety of factors, including seasonal variations, which could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.. Sales of our products are subject to seasonal variations and are sensitive to weather conditions. A significant portion of our revenues are attributable to footwear styles that are more suitable for fair weather and are derived from sales in the northern hemisphere. We typically experience our highest sales activity during the second and third quarters of the calendar year, when there is warmer. 15. Table of Contents. weather in the northern hemisphere. The effects of favorable or unfavorable weather on sales can be significant enough to affect our quarterly results which could adversely affect our common stock price. Quarterly results may also fluctuate as a result of other factors, including new style introductions, general economic conditions or changes in consumer preferences. Results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. This could lead to results outside of analyst and investor expectations, which could increase volatility of our stock price.. Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.. From time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, acquisitions of new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, which require substantial cash investment and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to risks and uncertainties. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect or the failure to integrate newly acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations.. Specifically, over the last several years, we have implemented numerous information systems designed to support various areas of our business, including a fully-integrated global accounting, operations, and finance enterprise resource planning system, and warehouse management, order management, and internet point-of-sale systems, as well as various interfaces between these systems and supporting back office systems. Issues in implementing or integrating new systems with our current operations, failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and require significant additional capital investments to remediate, and may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.. Our business relies significantly on the use of information technology. A significant disruption to our operational technology or data security breach could harm our reputation and/or our ability to effectively operate our business.. We rely heavily on the use of information technology systems and networks across all business functions. The future success and growth of our business depend on streamlined processes made available through information systems, global communications, internet activity, and other network processes. We rely exclusively on third-party information services providers worldwide for our information technology functions including network, help desk, hardware and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal, and tax requirements. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. Despite our current security and cybersecurity measures, our systems, and those of our third-party service providers, we may be vulnerable to information security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, credit card fraud, phishing, and interruption or loss of valuable business data. Any disruption to these systems or networks could result in product fulfillment delays, key personnel being unable to perform duties or communicate throughout the organization, loss of retail and internet sales, significant costs for data restoration, and other adverse impacts on our business and reputation. Denial of service attacks could also materially adversely affect our e-commerce business.. We routinely possess sensitive customer and employee information. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers' or employees' personal information, including credit card information, or a disruption of our business. Despite our existing cybersecurity procedures and controls, if our network becomes compromised, it could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships, harm our business, our reputation, and our financial results, which could result in fines or lawsuits, and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws, and costs resulting from consumer fraud.. We may fail to meet analyst and investor expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.. Our common stock is traded publicly and various securities analysts follow our financial results and frequently issue reports on us which include information about our historical financial results as well as their estimates of our future performance. These estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from management's estimates or expectations of our business. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and expectations of our investors, our stock price could decline.. 16. Table of Contents. Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.. We establish relationships with celebrity endorsers to develop, evaluate, and promote our products, as well as strengthen our brand. In a competitive environment, the costs associated with establishment and retention of these relationships may increase. If we are unable to maintain current associations and/or to establish new associations in the future, this could adversely affect our brand visibility and strength and result in a negative impact to financial results. In addition, actions taken by celebrity endorsers associated with our products that harm the public image and reputations of those endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.. Our senior revolving credit facility agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial measures and ratios and includes restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions. A breach of restrictive covenants may cause us to be in default under the Credit Agreement, and our lenders could foreclose on our assets.. Our Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants. A failure to maintain current revenue levels or an inability to control costs or capital expenditures could negatively impact our ability to meet these financial covenants. If we breach any of these restrictive covenants, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us or accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default or be unable to receive a waiver of the default from the lender. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lender could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or collection proceedings with respect to our assets, all of which secure our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.. The Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, and in some circumstances prohibit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt, sell, lease or transfer our assets, pay dividends on our common stock, make capital expenditures and investments, guarantee debt or obligations, create liens, repurchase our common stock, enter into transactions with our affiliates and enter into certain merger, consolidation or other reorganizations transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand the current or future downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.. The risks of maintaining significant cash abroad could adversely affect our cash flows in the U.S. business and financial results.. We have substantial cash requirements in the U.S., but the majority of our cash is generated and held abroad. We generally consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not our current intent to change this position. Cash held outside of the U.S. is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S., and under the Tax Act, could be repatriated without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes, noting that some states will continue to subject cash repatriations to income tax. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity.. Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities and the results of tax audits or tax litigation could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the outcome of income tax audits or tax litigation in various jurisdictions around the world. We are regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for prior tax years. Please refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings in Part I of this Form 10-K as well as Note 13  -  Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding current tax audits. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and we intend to defend our positions through litigation if necessary, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain and could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Moreover, we could be subject to assessments of substantial additional taxes and/or fines or penalties relating to ongoing or future audits, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could also adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher income tax liabilities. Recent developments, including U.S. tax reform, the European Commission's investigations of local country tax authority rulings and whether those rulings comply with European Union rules on state aid, as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's. 17. Table of Contents. project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, continue to change long-standing tax principles. These and any other additional changes could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.. The ongoing effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") and the refinement of provisional estimates could make our results difficult to predict.. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate in the future as a result of the Tax Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law that may have a meaningful impact on our provision for income taxes in the future. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act.. Additionally, on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. Specifically, SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act on their financial statements. This measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements, and cannot exceed one year.. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), and other standard-setting bodies may issue guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret the Tax Act and any additional guidance issued by the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations as well as our effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made.. We are subject to periodic litigation, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.. From time to time, we initiate litigation or are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. For a detailed discussion of our current material legal proceedings, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An unfavorable outcome in any of these proceedings or any future legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, and financial results. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against us. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.. We rely on technical innovation to compete in the market for our products.. Our success relies on continued innovation in both materials and design of footwear. Research and development is a key part of our continued success and growth, and we rely on experts to develop and test our materials and products. CrosliteTM, our branded proprietary closed-cell resin, is the primary raw material used in our footwear and some of our accessories. CrosliteTM is carefully formulated to create soft, durable, extremely lightweight, odor-resistant, water-resistant, and non-marking footwear that conforms to the shape of the foot and increases comfort. We continue to invest in research and development in order to refine our materials to enhance these properties and to develop new properties for specific applications. We strive to produce footwear featuring fun, comfort, color, and functionality. If we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.. We depend on key personnel across the globe, the loss of whom would harm our business.. We rely on executives and senior management to drive the financial and operational performance of our business. Turnover of executives and senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations, and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult or may require us to offer more generous compensation packages to attract top executives. Changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. When we experience management turnover, we must successfully integrate any newly hired management personnel within our organization in a timely manner in order to achieve our operating objectives. The key initiatives directed by these executives may take time to implement and yield positive. 18. Table of Contents. results, and there can be no guarantee they will be successful. If our new executives do not perform up to expectations, we may experience declines in our financial performance and/or delays or failures in achieving our long-term growth strategy.. If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results and market confidence in our reported financial information could be adversely affected.. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results and market confidence in our reported financial information could be harmed, we could incur significant costs to evaluate and remediate weaknesses, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.. As of December 31, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which led us to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting as of such date was not effective. The material weaknesses identified were related to controls over the period end closing procedures and inventory monitoring, which were remediated as of December 31, 2016. The existence of a material weakness precludes management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and precludes our independent auditors from issuing an unqualified opinion that our internal controls are effective. In addition, a material weakness could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the price of our common stock. We also can make no assurances that we will be able to remediate any future internal control deficiencies timely and in a cost effective manner. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If we are unable to satisfactorily remediate future deficiencies or if we discover other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, such deficiencies may lead to misstatements in our financial statements or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial results and reputation.. Our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of an investment in our stock.. Our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware corporate law each contain provisions that could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.. Labor disruptions could adversely impact our business.. Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. Labor disputes impacting our suppliers, manufacturers, transportation carriers, or ports pose significant threat to our business, particularly if such disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons. Any such disruption could result in delayed or canceled orders by customers, unplanned inventory accumulation or shortages, and increased transportation and labor costs, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position.. Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant impact on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.. Extreme weather conditions or natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including damage to our supply chain, manufacturing or distribution centers, retail stores, changes in consumer preferences or spending priorities, energy shortages, and public health issues, could harm or disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors other suppliers, or customers, or result in economic instability that. 19. Table of Contents. may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses.. Risks Specific to Our Capital Stock. The issuance of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series A\") to Blackstone Capital Partners VI L.P. (\"Blackstone\") in 2014 and certain of its permitted transferees reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, may dilute the ownership of such holders, and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. The Company issued shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred Stock\") to Blackstone and certain of its permitted transferees (collectively, the \"Blackstone Purchasers\") in January 2014. The Blackstone Purchasers currently own all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017, the Blackstone Purchasers collectively own Series A Preferred Stock convertible into approximately 16.7% of our common stock. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends declared or paid on the Company's common stock and are entitled to vote together with the holders of the Company's common stock as a single class, in each case, on an as-converted basis. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock also have certain limited special approval rights, including with respect to the issuance of pari passu or senior equity securities of the Company.. Conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to common stock will dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We have granted the Blackstone Purchasers registration rights in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. These registration rights would facilitate the resale of such securities into the public market, and any such resale would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by the Blackstone Purchasers of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.. We are required to pay regular dividends on the Series A issued to Blackstone, which ranks senior to our common stock, and we may be required under certain circumstances to repurchase the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock; such obligations could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividend rights, and holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative cash dividends at a rate of 6.0% per annum of the stated value of $1,000 per share. If we fail to make timely dividend payments, the dividend rate will increase to 8.0% per annum until such time as all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid in full. In addition, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain redemption rights, including upon certain change in control events involving us, which, if exercised, could require us to repurchase all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock at 100% or more of the stated value of the shares, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends. Our obligations to pay regular dividends to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock or any required repurchase of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.. Blackstone may exercise significant influence over us, including through its ability to elect up to two members of our Board of Directors.. As of December 31, 2017, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by the Blackstone Purchasers represent approximately 16.7% of the voting rights of our common stock, on an as-converted basis, so the Blackstone Purchasers will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders. In addition, the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock grants certain consent rights to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock in respect of certain actions by the Company, including the issuance of pari passu or senior equity securities of the Company, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, any increase in the size of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") above eight members, the payment of certain distributions to our stockholders, and the origination or refinancing of a certain level of indebtedness. The Blackstone Purchasers may have interests that diverge from, or even conflict with, those of our other stockholders. For example, Blackstone and its affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us. Blackstone and its affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.. 20. Table of Contents. In addition, the Investment Agreement grants Blackstone certain rights to designate directors to serve on our Board. For so long as the Blackstone Purchasers (i) beneficially own at least 95% of the Series A Preferred Stock or the as-converted common stock purchased pursuant to the Investment Agreement or (ii) maintain beneficial ownership of at least 12.5% of our outstanding common stock (the \"Two-Director Threshold\"), Blackstone will have the right to designate for nomination two directors to our Board. For so long as the Blackstone Purchasers beneficially own shares of Series A Preferred Stock or the as-converted common stock purchased pursuant to the Investment Agreement that represent less than the Two-Director Threshold but more than 25% of the number of shares of the as-converted common stock purchased pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Blackstone will have the right to designate for nomination one director to our Board. The directors designated by Blackstone are entitled to serve on Board committees, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules."
