[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following factors may affect the growth and profitability of Milestone Scientific and should be considered by any prospective purchaser or current holder of our securities.  Our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.. We have a history of operating losses that are expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will generate significant revenues or whether we will achieve or sustain profitability.. We are a small, medical device company with a history of limited revenue and significant operating losses and our prospects must be considered considering the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by similarly situated companies.  With only one exception (i.e., 2013), we have generated net losses in all periods since the commencement of our operations, including operating losses of approximately $5.2 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Overall, at December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $78.6 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs in the future and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we undertake to commercialize our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System.  Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders' equity.  Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with product development, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever generate significant revenues or if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability. We require additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate commercialization efforts of our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception.  During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash flow used in operations was approximately $ 1.2 million and approximately $5.4 million, respectively.  We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on product development and commercialization activities, including the commercialization of our recently FDA-approved CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System.  Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance future cash needs through equity or debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements.  In addition, we may seek other alternatives to maximize the value of our intellectual property for dental applications, to focus more on, and finance, our medical applications.  If we are unable to raise additional capital, we will have to delay, curtail or eliminate the commercialization of our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System, our efforts to obtain FDA approval of our intra-articular device and/or our product development and other commercialization efforts.. Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted.  Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions.  In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing arrangements or the disposition of any of our assets, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. Relying exclusively on third parties to manufacture our products, changes in our informal manufacturing arrangements made by the manufacturer of our devices and disruptions at the manufacturing facility of our manufacturer exposes us to risks that may harm our business.. We have limited internal experience in manufacturing operations and have not historically established our own manufacturing facilities.  We currently lack the internal resources to manufacture any of our products, including our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System.  At present, we have an informal arrangement with the manufacturer of our products.  While we have more than one manufacturer of the hand pieces for our devices, we only have a single manufacturer manufacturing our devices.  Our current arrangement with such sole source of supply is on a purchase order by purchase order basis.  As a result, we do not have price protection or a supply commitment for our devices.  If the manufacturer insists on a material change in terms or determines to discontinue manufacture of our devices, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.. 14. An operational disruption in the facility of the manufacturer of our devices could negatively impact production and our financial results.  The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tropical storm, earthquake, tornado, severe weather, flood, fire or other unanticipated problems such as labor difficulties, equipment failure or unscheduled maintenance could cause operational disruptions of varied duration.  These types of disruptions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations to varying degrees dependent upon the facility, the duration of the disruption, our ability to shift business to another facility or find alternative sources of supply.  Any losses due to these events may not be covered by our existing insurance policies or may be subject to certain deductibles.  Given our current manufacturing relationships, it is possible that our manufacturing requirements may exceed the available supply allotments under our existing agreements.  Our anticipated future reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following additional risks:. We may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited, and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor.  This approval would require new testing and compliance inspections.  In addition, a new manufacturer would have to develop substantially equivalent processes for production of our products.. <U+25CF>   Contract manufacturers might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs.. <U+25CF>   Contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.. <U+25CF>   Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards and our manufacturers may be found to be in noncompliance with certain regulations, which may impact their ability to manufacture our product.. <U+25CF>   If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.  We may be required to pay fees or other costs for access to such improvements. Each of these risks could delay the commercialization of our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System, limit our available supply of The Wand® STA for dental applications, cause damage to our reputation, result in higher costs and/or deprive us of potential product revenues.. We depend on two principal manufacturers. If we cannot maintain our existing relationships or develop new ones, we may have to cease operations.. Milestone Scientific and its subsidiary has informal arrangements with the manufacturer of the Wand STA Instrument, CompuDent®, CompuMed® CompuFlo Epidural, and CompuFlo Intra-Articular and with one of the principal manufacturers of the handpieces, for those items, respectively. Pursuant to the informal arrangements, they manufacture these devices and handpieces under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone Scientific has a manufacturing agreement with one of the principal manufacturers, which is a related party, of its handpieces pursuant to which they manufacture products under specific purchase orders but without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the Wand STA Instrument, CompuDent®, CompuMed® CompuFlo Epidural and CompuFlo Intra-Articular devices since the commencement of production in 1998, and the manufacturer of its handpieces since 2003.. However, termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect our ability to produce and sell these products. Though other alternate sources of supply for handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to recover its existing tools or have new tools produced to establish relationships with new suppliers. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of the supply, whether as a result or termination of the relationship, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.. 15. Issues with product quality could have a material adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.. In general, our success depends upon the quality of our products.  Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products.  Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program.  A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.  An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.. We may be subject to product liability claims that are not fully covered by insurance and that could put Milestone Scientific under financial strain.. Milestone Scientific could be subject to claims for personal injury from the alleged malfunction or misuse of the dental and medical products. While Milestone Scientific carries liability insurance that is believed to be adequate, there is no assurance that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay such claims should they be successful. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If physicians do not accept nor use our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System, our ability to generate revenue from sales will be materially impaired.. Although the FDA has cleared our application to begin marketing the CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System, this is no assurance that physicians, hospitals, clinics and other health care providers will accept and use it.  Acceptance and use of the CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System will depend on many factors including:. <U+25CF>          perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our product;. <U+25CF>          cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products and systems;. <U+25CF>          convenience, ease of use and reliability of our product relative to competing products and systems;. <U+25CF>          patient satisfaction;. <U+25CF>          product availability as well as, manufacturer warranty, maintenance, and customer and technical support;. <U+25CF>          availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payers; and. <U+25CF>          effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.. Because we expect sales of the CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System to generate substantially all our medical product revenues in the near-term, the failure of this product to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or make such financing difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.. Developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.. The medical device industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change.  We expect that other companies (or individuals), whether located in the United States or abroad, will pursue the development of alternative injection-based or imaging-based systems that will compete with our products.  Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities, longer product development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do.  These companies also compete with us to attract qualified personnel and parties for acquisitions, joint ventures or other collaborations.  As a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their products.. 16. If we are unable to adequately protect our patents, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, if our patents are challenged or if our provisional patent applications do not get approved, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.. Intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names and trade dress, are important to our business.  We will endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions in which our products are produced or used and in jurisdictions into which our products are imported.  Our success will depend to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights.  However, we may be unable to obtain or maintain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions.  Although we own and have applied for patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights.  Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised.  A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Similarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon third party intellectual property rights.. We believe that the intellectual property underlying our products is a competitive advantage.  We rely on a combination of patent rights, trade secrets and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so.  There can be no assurance that our patents, trade secret policies and practices or other agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property.  Our issued patents may be challenged, found to be over-broad or otherwise invalidated in subsequent proceedings before courts or the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Even if enforceable, we cannot provide any assurances that they will provide significant protection from competition.  The processes, systems, and/or security measures we use to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies resulting from such breaches.  In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.  There can be no assurance that the confidentiality, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties with access to our proprietary information to protect our trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and other proprietary rights, or any other security measures relating to such trade secrets, proprietary technology, processes and proprietary rights, will be adequate, will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.  To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our managements attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings.  A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.. We could lose our market advantage earlier than expected.. We believe that our products represent a significant improvement over any existing drug delivery injection system in use today.  However, this competitive advantage can evaporate quickly if we are not able to commercialize our products quickly.  In the medical device industry, the majority of an innovative products commercial value is realized during the early stages of commercialization, before competing products are developed.  Our market advantage is based, in part, on patent rights and the need for new competing products and systems to obtain regulatory approval before they can be commercialized.  The scope of our patent rights may be limited and may also depend on the availability of meaningful legal remedies.. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, through patents or otherwise, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent the commercialization of competing anesthetic delivery systems.  In some countries, basic patent protections for our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file in those markets.  In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable, and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty.. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to commercialize our technologies, and we cannot assure you that the required licenses would be available on reasonable terms or at all.. Third parties may claim that one or more aspects of our technologies or products may infringe on their intellectual property rights.. 17. Our computer-controlled anesthesia systems are complex systems and numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in fields that relate to the development and commercialization of drug delivery systems.  In addition, many companies have employed intellectual property litigation as a strategy to gain a competitive advantage.  It is possible that infringement claims may occur as the number of products and competitors in our market increases.  In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a greater risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims.  We cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.  If any of our computer-controlled anesthesia systems are found to infringe third party patent rights, we could be prohibited from manufacturing and commercializing the infringing technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable third-party patent and pay royalties or are able to design around such patent.  We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and we may not be able to redesign the system to avoid infringement.  Even if we can redesign our products or processes to avoid an infringement claim, our efforts to design around the patent could require significant time, effort and expense and ultimately may lead to an inferior or costlier product.  Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.  Furthermore, if any such claim is successful, a court could order us to pay substantial damages, including compensatory damages for any infringement, plus prejudgment interest and could, in certain circumstances, treble the compensatory damages and award attorney fees.  These damages could be substantial and could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.  A court also could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently prohibit us, our licensees, if any, and our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing one or more of our products or using our proprietary technologies or processes, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities.  Any of these events could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.. We are exposed to the risks inherent in international sales and operations.. In 2017, export sales outside of the United States made up approximately 57% of our total sales, and we sell our products to customers in approximately 53 countries.  We have exposure to risks of operating in many foreign countries, including:. <U+25CF>         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, could increase the end user cost for instruments;. <U+25CF>         restrictions on, or difficulties and costs associated with, the currency exchange from foreign countries to obtain US dollars;. <U+25CF>         difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;. <U+25CF>         unexpected changes in political or regulatory environments;. <U+25CF>         political and economic instability;. <U+25CF>         import and export restrictions and other trade barriers;. <U+25CF>         difficulties in obtaining approval for significant transactions;. Continued instability in the credit and financial markets may negatively impact our ability to commercialize our products.. Financial markets in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, significant volatility in security prices, declining valuations of certain investments, as well as severely diminished liquidity and credit availability.  Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions continues to be reduced.  As a small medical device company, we rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business, including contract manufacturing of products, distribution of our products and sales and marketing.  These third parties may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us due to tightening of global credit from time to time, which would adversely affect our business.  The continued volatility in the credit and financial market conditions may also negatively impact our ability to access capital and credit markets and our ability to manage our cash balance.  While we are unable to predict the continued duration and severity of any adverse conditions in the United States and other countries, any of the circumstances mentioned above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow or cash position.. 18. Our ability to commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from governmental agencies, health administration authorities, private health maintenance organizations and health insurers and other healthcare payers.. Our ability to generate revenues from our products will be diminished if the products sell for inadequate prices or hospitals or physicians are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement for the cost they incur in connection with the use of the product.  Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products.  Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.  Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for products.  Insurance coverage may not be available, or reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover the charges for the use of such product.  If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for any of our products, market acceptance of such product could be reduced.  Prices in many countries, including many in Europe, are subject to local regulation and price controls.  In the United States, where pricing levels for medical products, procedures and services are substantially established by third-party payors, including Medicare, if payors reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product, it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue use of the product, to substitute lower cost products even if the alternatives are less effective or to seek additional price-related concessions.  These actions could have a negative effect on our financial results.  The existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures on our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance.. We are subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation, including regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes. Failure by us to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The FDA regulates the approval, manufacturing and sales and marketing of many of our products in the United States. Significant government regulation also exists in other countries in which we conduct business. As a device manufacturer, we are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDAs Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product recalls or related field actions, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing. Efficacy or safety concerns, an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace, and/or manufacturing quality issues with respect to our products could lead to product recalls or related field actions, withdrawals, and/or declining sales.. We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.. Our operations are and will continue to be directly, or indirectly through our distributors, customers and health care professionals, subject to various U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act of 1977 (FCPA). These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, and marketing and education programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Several courts have interpreted the statutes intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. An alleged violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may be used as a predicate offense to establish liability pursuant to other federal laws and regulations such as the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.. 19. The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as relators or whistleblowers, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and health care companies to have to defend False Claim Act actions. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions expanding the ability of certain relators to bring actions that would have been previously dismissed under prior law. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact or modify their state false claims act to be at least as effective as the federal False Claims Act by granting states a portion of any federal Medicaid funds recovered through Medicaid-related actions. Most states have enacted state false claims laws, and many of those states included laws with qui tam provisions.. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Manufacturers must also disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per year for knowing violations and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the United States, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. These laws could affect our promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we could have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our products. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans will impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of suspension or exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.. In addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other countries anti-corruption/anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. The FCPA prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.. Excessive returns under our Exclusive Distribution and Supply Agreement with Henry Schein, Inc. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In June 2016, we entered into a new exclusive distribution and supply agreement with Henry Schein pursuant to which they were appointed as the exclusive distributor for our dental products in the United States and Canada.  Under that agreement, Henry Schein has a right to return our products for full credit against the purchase price paid by them under limited circumstances in accordance with such agreement, including but not limited to, returns due to shipment error by us or factory defect.  Excessive returns during any calendar year could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations.. Any governmental entity that regulates our operations in the country in which they are located may enact new legislation or adopt new laws and regulations or policies at any time, and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time in any of the countries in which our operations or projects are located. We have no control over any such changes. Any new laws or regulations governing our operations could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and prospects.. We rely on the continuing services of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.. We depend on the personal efforts and abilities of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.  Milestone Scientific maintains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of $1,000,000 on the life of its Interim Chief Executive Officer.  However, the loss of his services or the services of our Director of Clinical Affairs, on whom we maintain no insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results of operations and prospects.. 20. Milestone Scientific is effectively controlled by a limited number of stockholders.. Milestone Scientifics principal stockholders, Leonard Osser, Gian Domenico Trombetta and K. Tucker Andersen beneficially own approximately 39.68% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, they can exercise substantial control over our affairs and corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including electing directors, selling all or substantially all our assets, merging with another entity or amending our certificate of incorporation. This de facto control could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for Milestone Scientifics securities.  In addition, because of the concentration of ownership of our shares of common stock, our stockholders may from time to time, observe instances where there may be less liquidity in the public markets for our securities.. Adherence to Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be costly and compliance could have an adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.. The management of Milestone Scientific has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.  In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Milestone Scientific complied with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements to include in the annual report a management report on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting.  In 2017 and 2016, Milestone Scientific utilized an outside consultant on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting. This expense amounted to approximately $15,000 and $20,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively and the cost is expected to continue in 2018.. The market price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.. Our stock price may experience substantial volatility because of many factors, including:. <U+25CF>          sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;. <U+25CF>          delay or failure in initiating our strategy to commercialize our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System;. <U+25CF>          the success of our strategy to commercialize our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System;. <U+25CF>          announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals or new product introductions that could adversely impact the market acceptance or competitive advantages of our CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System;. <U+25CF>          developments concerning our licensors or product manufacturers;. <U+25CF>          litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;. <U+25CF>          our ability to successfully develop and commercialize to products and services for the healthcare industry;. <U+25CF>          conditions in the medical device industries;. <U+25CF>          governmental regulation and legislation;. <U+25CF>          variations in our anticipated or actual operating results; and. <U+25CF>          change in securities analysts estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts expectations.. Many of these factors are beyond our control.  The stock markets in general, and the market for small, medical device companies have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.  These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.  These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our common stock.. Almost all our 33,191,571 outstanding shares of common stock, as well as a substantial number of shares of our common stock underlying outstanding warrants, are available for sale in the public market, either freely or pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  In addition, we have an effective S-3 registration statement on file with the SEC covering the sale by us of up to $30 million of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt, convertible debt and warrants.  To date, we have sold $3,435,775 (2,452,900 shares) of common stock under that registration statement.  Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our common stock. 21. We have never paid and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.. We have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and we currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business.  In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.  These provisions include:. <U+25CF>   the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and the ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and. <U+25CF>   limitations on filling of vacancies could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of our company.. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years, has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.  They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.. If we fail to adhere to the strict listing requirements of NYSE American, we may be subject to delisting.  As a result, our stock price may decline, and our common stock may be delisted.  If our stock were no longer listed on NYSE American, the liquidity of our securities likely would be impaired.. Our common stock currently trades on the NYSE American under the symbol MLSS. If we fail to adhere to NYSE American's strict listing criteria, including with respect to stock price, our market capitalization and stockholders equity, our stock may be delisted.  This could potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which may be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage.  As a result, an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock.  Any failure at any time to meet the continuing NYSE American listing requirements could have an adverse impact on the value of and trading activity in our common stock. Although we currently satisfy the listing criteria for NYSE American, if our stock price declines, we could be at risk of falling below NYSE American continuing listing criteria."
