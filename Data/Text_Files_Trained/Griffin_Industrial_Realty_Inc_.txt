[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.. Griffin's real estate business is subject to a number of risks. The risk factors discussed below are those that management deems to be material, but they may not be the only risks facing Griffin. Additional risks not currently known or currently deemed not to be material may also impact Griffin. If any of the following risks occur, Griffin's business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. Investors should also refer to Griffin's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for any material updates to these risk factors.. Risks Related to Griffin's Business and Properties. Griffin's real estate portfolio is concentrated in the industrial real estate sector, and its business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.. 88% of Griffin's buildings are warehouse/distribution facilities and light manufacturing facilities in the industrial real estate sector. This level of concentration exposes Griffin to the risk of economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector to a greater extent than if its properties were more diversified across other sectors of the real estate industry. In particular, an economic downturn affecting the leasing market for industrial properties could have a material adverse effect on Griffin's results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends to stockholders.. Griffin's real estate portfolio is geographically concentrated, which causes it to be especially susceptible to adverse developments in those markets.. In addition to general, regional, national and international economic conditions, Griffin's operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific geographic markets in which it has concentrations of properties. The portfolio includes holdings in Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania and Concord, North Carolina, which represented 61%, 32% and 7% of Griffin's portfolio by square footage, respectively, as of November 30, 2017.  This geographic concentration could adversely affect Griffin's operating performance if conditions become less favorable in any of the states or regions in which it has a concentration of properties. Griffin cannot assure that any of its markets will grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will be favorable to owners and operators of properties. Griffin's operations may also be adversely affected if competing properties are built in its target markets. The construction of new facilities by competitors would increase capacity in the marketplace, and an increase in the amount of vacancies in competitors' properties and negative absorption of space could result in Griffin experiencing longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates or hindering renewals by existing tenants. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in Griffin's target markets, or any decrease in demand for industrial space resulting from the regulatory environment, business climate or energy or fiscal problems in these markets, could materially and adversely impact Griffin's results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends to stockholders.. 13. Table of Contents. Griffin's ability to grow its portfolio partially depends on its ability to develop properties, which may suffer under certain circumstances.. Griffin intends to continue to develop properties when warranted by its assessment of market conditions. Griffin's general construction and development activities include the risks that:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin's assessment of market conditions may be inaccurate;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment activities may require the acquisition of undeveloped land.  Competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price of that land;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require Griffin to abandon its activities entirely with respect to a project;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction costs (including required offsite infrastructure costs) may exceed Griffin's original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable than projected or unprofitable because Griffin may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin may abandon development opportunities after it begins to explore them and as a result, Griffin may fail to recover costs already incurred. If Griffin alters or discontinues its development efforts, costs of the investment may need to be expensed rather than capitalized and Griffin may determine the investment is impaired, resulting in a loss;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin may expend funds on and devote management's time to projects that it does not complete;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toccupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties may not meet Griffin's expectations. This may result in lower than projected occupancy and rental rates resulting in an investment that is less profitable than projected or unprofitable; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin may incur losses under construction warranties, guaranties and delay damages under Griffin's contracts with tenants and other customers.. Griffin's ability to achieve growth in its portfolio partially depends in part on Griffin's ability to acquire properties, which may suffer under certain circumstances.. Griffin acquires individual properties and in the future, may acquire portfolios of properties.  Griffin's acquisition activities and their success are generally subject to the following risks:. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twhen Griffin is able to locate a desirable property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquired properties may fail to perform as expected;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than Griffin's estimates;. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacquired properties may be located in new markets where Griffin faces risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and. § \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties and operating entities, into its existing operations, and as a result, Griffin's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.. 14. Table of Contents. Griffin may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against Griffin based upon ownership of those properties, Griffin might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect its cash flow.. Weakness in Griffin's office/flex portfolio could negatively impact its business.. Griffin's office/flex portfolio, which comprises 12% of its total square footage and was 71% occupied as of November 30, 2017, is concentrated in the north submarket of Hartford.  The demand for office/flex space in this market is weak and competitive, with market vacancy in excess of 30% as of December 31, 2017, according to the Q4 2017 CBRE|New England Report. There is no certainty that Griffin will retain existing tenants or attract new tenants to its office/flex buildings.  Re-leasing Griffin's office/flex properties typically requires greater investment per square foot than for Griffin's industrial/warehouse properties and could negatively impact Griffin's results of operations and cash flow.. Griffin may experience increased operating costs, which could adversely affect Griffin's results of operations.. Griffin's properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as real estate taxes, fuel, utilities, labor, repairs and maintenance, building materials and insurance. While many of Griffin's current tenants generally are obligated to pay a significant portion of these costs, there are no assurances that existing or new tenants will agree to or make such payments.  If operating expenses increase, Griffin may not be able to pass these costs on to its tenants and, therefore, any such increases could have an adverse effect on Griffin's results of operations and cash flow.. Griffin relies on third party managers for day-to-day property management of certain of its properties.. Griffin relies on local third party managers for the day-to-day management of its Lehigh Valley and Concord, North Carolina properties. To the extent that Griffin uses a third party manager, the cash flows from its Lehigh Valley and Concord properties may be adversely affected if the property manager fails to provide quality services. These third party managers may fail to manage Griffin's properties effectively or in accordance with their agreements with Griffin, may be negligent in their performance and may engage in criminal or fraudulent activity. If any of these events occur, Griffin could incur losses or face liabilities from the loss or injury to its property or to persons at its properties. In addition, disputes may arise between Griffin and these third party managers, and Griffin may incur significant expenses to resolve those disputes or terminate the relevant agreement with these third parties and locate and engage competent and cost-effective alternative service providers to manage the relevant properties. Additionally, third party managers may manage and own other properties that may compete with Griffin's properties, which may result in conflicts of interest and decisions regarding the operation of Griffin's properties that are not in Griffin's best interests. Griffin likely would rely on third-party managers in any new markets it enters through its acquisition activities.. Unfavorable events affecting Griffin's existing and potential tenants and its properties, or negative market conditions that may affect Griffin's existing and potential tenants, could have an adverse impact on Griffin's ability to attract new tenants, re-let space, collect rent and renew leases, and thus could have a negative effect on Griffin's results of operations and cash flow.. The substantial majority of Griffin's revenue is derived from lease revenue from its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings.  Griffin's results of operations and cash flows depend on its ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. Therefore, Griffin could be adversely affected by various factors and events over which Griffin has limited control, such as:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates in the areas where Griffin's properties are located;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdefaults by Griffin's tenants due to bankruptcy or other factors or their failure to pay rent on a timely basis;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tphysical damage to Griffin's properties and the need to repair such damage;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic or physical decline of the areas where Griffin's properties are located; and. 15. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential risk of functional obsolescence of Griffin's properties over time.. If a tenant is unable to pay rent due to Griffin, Griffin may be forced to evict the tenant, or engage in other remedies, which may be expensive and time consuming and may adversely affect Griffin's results of operation and cash flows.. If Griffin's tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, Griffin may not be able to re-lease the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, or new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable to Griffin than current lease terms, or may require Griffin to incur significant costs, such as for renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs.. Any of these events could adversely affect Griffin's results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make dividend payments and service its indebtedness.. A significant portion of Griffin's costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance costs, and debt service payments, are fixed, which means that they generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from its properties.. Declining real estate valuations and any related impairment charges could materially adversely affect Griffin's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.. Griffin reviews the carrying value of its properties when circumstances, such as adverse market conditions, indicate a potential impairment may exist. Griffin bases its review on an estimate of the future cash flows (excluding interest charges) expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition on an undiscounted basis. Griffin considers factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. With respect to undeveloped land, Griffin evaluates the cash flow to be generated from the potential use or sale of such land as compared to the costs, including entitlement and infrastructure costs for the intended use or costs required to prepare the land for sale. If Griffin's evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.. Impairment losses have a direct impact on Griffin's results of operations because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to Griffin's operating results. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. A worsening real estate market may cause Griffin to reevaluate the assumptions used in its impairment analysis. Impairment charges could materially adversely affect Griffin's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.. Griffin's use of nonrecourse mortgage loans could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.. As of November 30, 2017, Griffin had indebtedness under nonrecourse mortgage loans of approximately $131.0 million, collateralized by approximately 88% of the total square footage of its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings. If a significant number of Griffin's tenants were unable to meet their obligations to Griffin or if Griffin were unable to lease a significant amount of space in its properties on economically favorable lease terms, there would be a risk that Griffin would not have sufficient cash flow from operations for payments of required principal and interest on these loans. If Griffin was unable to make such payments and was to default, the property collateralizing the mortgage loan could be foreclosed upon, and Griffin's financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, two of Griffin's nonrecourse mortgage loans contain cross default provisions. A default under a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause Griffin to automatically default on another loan.. Griffin's use of financing arrangements that include balloon payment obligations could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.. Approximately 91% of Griffin's nonrecourse mortgage loans as of November 30, 2017 require a lump-sum or \"balloon\" payment at maturity. Griffin's ability to make a balloon payment at maturity may be uncertain and may depend upon its ability to obtain additional financing. At the time the balloon payment is due, Griffin may or may not be. 16. Table of Contents. able to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original mortgage terms. If Griffin were to be unable to refinance the balloon payment, then it may be forced to sell the property or pay the balloon payment using its existing cash on hand or other liquidity sources, or the property could be foreclosed. Any balloon payments that Griffin makes out of its existing cash or liquidity may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and leave it with insufficient cash to invest in other properties, pay dividends to stockholders or meet its other obligations.. Griffin's failure to effectively hedge against interest rate fluctuation could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.. Griffin has entered into several interest rate swap agreements to hedge its interest rate exposures related to its variable rate nonrecourse mortgages on certain of its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings. These agreements have costs and involve the risks that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing Griffin's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. The failure to hedge effectively against interest rate fluctuations may materially adversely affect Griffin's results of operations if interest rates were to rise materially. Additionally, any settlement charges incurred to terminate an interest rate swap agreement may result in increased interest expense, which may also have an adverse effect on Griffin's results of operations.. Griffin may suffer adverse effects as a result of the terms of and covenants relating to its revolving credit facility.. Griffin's continued ability to borrow under its $15 million revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with financial and other covenants. Griffin's failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under this credit facility, and Griffin may then be required to repay amounts outstanding, if any, under the facility with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to Griffin, or may be available only on unattractive terms.. Griffin relies on key personnel.. Griffin's success depends to a significant degree upon the contribution of certain key personnel, including but not limited to Griffin's Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Griffin Industrial, LLC's Senior Vice President and Griffin Industrial, LLC's Vice President of Construction.  If any of Griffin's key personnel were to cease employment, Griffin's operating results could suffer. Griffin's ability to retain its senior management group or attract suitable replacements should any members of the senior management group leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation on their availability could adversely affect Griffin's results of operations and cash flows.  Griffin has not obtained and does not expect to obtain key man life insurance on any of its key personnel.. Risks Related to the Real Estate Industry. Changing or adverse political and economic conditions and credit markets may impact Griffin's results of operations and financial condition.. Griffin's real estate business may be affected by market conditions and political and economic uncertainty experienced by the U.S. economy as a whole, conditions in the credit markets or by local economic conditions in the markets in which its properties are located. Such conditions may impact Griffin's results of operations, financial condition or ability to expand its operations and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of the following:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tThe financial condition of Griffin's tenants may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA decrease in investment spending, the curtailment of expansion plans or significant job losses may decrease demand for Griffin's industrial/warehouse and office/flex space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tGriffin's ability to borrow on terms and conditions that it finds acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce its ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, and/or increase future interest expense;. 17. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tReduced values of Griffin's properties may limit its ability to obtain debt financing collateralized by its properties or may limit the proceeds from such potential financings;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tA weak economy may limit sales of land intended for commercial, industrial and residential use;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tChanges in supply or demand for similar or competing properties in an area where Griffin's properties are located may adversely affect Griffin's competitive position and market rental rates in that area; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tLong periods of time may elapse between the commencement and the completion of Griffin's projects.. An increase in interest rates could adversely impact Griffin's ability to refinance existing debt or to finance new developments and acquisitions.. Rising interest rates could limit Griffin's ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms, or at all, when it matures. Interest rates have been in recent years, and currently remain, low by historical standards.  However, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate multiple times in 2017, and further interest rate increases may occur. If interest rates increase, so will Griffin's interest costs, which would adversely affect Griffin's cash flow and ability to pay principal and interest on its debt.. From time to time, Griffin enters into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. These agreements, which are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on Griffin, expose Griffin to the risks that the other parties to the agreements might not perform, or that Griffin could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, or that the agreements might be unenforceable and the underlying transactions would fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under relevant accounting guidance.. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to lend to Griffin for use towards potential acquisitions or development costs, thereby limiting its ability to grow its property portfolio.. Griffin may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in its industry.. Griffin experiences a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse buildings, for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings and for attracting tenants for its properties.  Griffin competes with well-capitalized real estate investors such as pension funds and their advisors, private real estate investment funds, bank and insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, including REITs, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity. Some of these competitors may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial or other terms than Griffin is able to offer.. Griffin may experience increased costs of raw materials and energy, which could adversely affect its operations.. Griffin's construction activities and maintenance of its current portfolio could be adversely affected by increases in raw materials or energy costs. As petroleum and other energy costs increase, products used in the construction of Griffin's facilities, such as steel, masonry, asphalt, cement and building products may increase. An increase in the cost of building new facilities could negatively impact Griffin's future operating results through increased depreciation expense. An increase in construction costs would also require increased investment in Griffin's real estate assets, which may lower the return on investment in new facilities. An increase in energy costs could increase Griffin's building operating expenses and thereby lower Griffin's operating results.. Real estate investments are illiquid, and Griffin may not be able to sell its properties when Griffin determines it is appropriate to do so.. Real estate properties are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity could limit Griffin's ability to react promptly to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provide for the ability to exchange \"like-kind\" property to. 18. Table of Contents. defer income taxes related to a gain on sale. The illiquidity of real estate properties may limit Griffin's ability to find a replacement property to effectuate such an exchange.. Potential environmental liabilities could result in substantial costs.. Griffin has properties in Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania and Concord, North Carolina in addition to extensive land holdings in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Florida. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, Griffin may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products at its properties because of its current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If previously unidentified environmental problems arise, Griffin may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect its cash flow. As an owner or operator of properties, Griffin may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean - up costs incurred in connection with a contamination. The law typically imposes cleanup responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Changes in environmental regulations may impact the development potential of Griffin's undeveloped land or could increase operating costs due to the cost of complying with new regulations.. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require Griffin to make expenditures that adversely impact Griffin's operating results.. All of Griffin's properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). The ADA generally requires that places of public accommodation comply with federal requirements related to access and use by people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the United States government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. Expenditures related to complying with the provisions of the ADA could adversely affect Griffin's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Griffin is required to operate its properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to Griffin's properties. Griffin may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on Griffin's operating results and financial condition and Griffin's ability to satisfy debt obligations and issue dividends to stockholders.. Governmental regulations and control could adversely affect Griffin's real estate development activities.. Griffin's operations are subject to governmental regulations that affect real estate development, such as local zoning ordinances. Any changes in such regulations may impact the ability of Griffin to develop its properties or increase Griffin's costs of development. Subdivision and other residential development may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate residential growth. Commercial and industrial development activities of Griffin's undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies.. Uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect Griffin's business, results of operations and financial condition.. Griffin carries comprehensive insurance coverage, including property, fire, terrorism and loss of rental revenue. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits. However, there are certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not fully insured against. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of Griffin's properties, Griffin could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenue from the properties affected.. Volatility in the capital and credit markets could materially adversely impact Griffin.. Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets could make it more difficult to borrow money. Market volatility could hinder Griffin's ability to obtain new debt financing or refinance maturing debt on favorable terms, or at all. Any financing or refinancing issues could materially adversely affect Griffin. Market turmoil and the tightening of credit can lead to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity in general, which also could materially adversely impact Griffin, including its ability to acquire and dispose of assets on favorable terms, or at all.. 19. Table of Contents. If Griffin fails to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately, which may adversely affect the per share trading price of its common stock and its business.. Griffin's efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the related regulations regarding its required assessment of internal control over financial reporting and its external auditors' audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. Griffin's system of internal controls may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations, and there can be no guarantee that its internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness or significant deficiency, in Griffin's internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of its results of operations, restatements of its financial statements and a decline in its stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect Griffin's business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.. Information technology (\"IT\") security breaches and other incidents could disrupt Griffin's operations, compromise confidential information maintained by Griffin, and damage Griffin's reputation, all of which could negatively impact Griffin's business, results of operations and the per share trading price of its common stock.. As part of Griffin's normal business activities, it uses information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain its business records. Griffin's computer systems, including its backup systems, are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack and data theft), usage errors and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. If Griffin's computer systems and its backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, Griffin could suffer interruptions in its operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information, which could damage its reputation and require Griffin to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. There can be no assurance that the security efforts and measures Griffin has implemented will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.. Griffin is subject to litigation that may adversely impact operating results.. From time to time, Griffin may be a party to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which could become significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, Griffin can offer no assurance that a future adverse development related to existing litigation or any future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Griffin is exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.. Griffin is exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. Griffin's properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, Griffin's exposure to these events could increase.. As a real estate owner and developer, Griffin may be adversely impacted in the future by stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings.  Griffin may be required to make improvements to its existing properties to meet such standards and the costs to meet these standards may increase Griffin's costs for new construction.. Griffin's properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation.. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of Griffin's properties could require Griffin to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant. 20. Table of Contents. mold or other airborne contaminants could expose Griffin to liability from its tenants, employees of its tenants or others if property damage or personal injury is alleged to have occurred.. Risks Related to Griffin's Organization and Structure. The concentrated ownership of Griffin common stock by members of the Cullman and Ernst families may limit other Griffin stockholders' ability to influence Griffin's corporate and management policies.. Members of the Cullman and Ernst families (the \"Cullman and Ernst Group\"), which include Frederick M. Danziger, Griffin's Executive Chairman, Michael S. Gamzon, a director and Griffin's President and Chief Executive Officer and Edgar M. Cullman, Jr., a director of Griffin, members of their families and trusts for their benefit, partnerships in which they own substantial interests and charitable foundations on whose boards of directors they sit, owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 45.6% of the outstanding common stock of Griffin as of November 30, 2017. There is an informal understanding that the persons and entities included in the Cullman and Ernst Group will vote together the shares owned by each of them. As a result, the Cullman and Ernst Group may effectively control the determination of Griffin's corporate and management policies and may limit other Griffin stockholders' ability to influence Griffin's corporate and management policies.. Griffin's board of directors may change its investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and Griffin may become more highly leveraged, which may increase Griffin's risk of default under its debt obligations.. Griffin's investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by its board of directors. Accordingly, Griffin's stockholders do not control these policies. Further, Griffin's charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that Griffin may incur. Griffin's board of directors may alter or eliminate its current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. If this policy changed, Griffin could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in its debt service. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on Griffin's obligations. In addition, a change in Griffin's investment policies, including the manner in which Griffin allocates its resources across the portfolio or the types of assets in which Griffin seeks to invest, may increase its exposure to interest rate risk, real estate market fluctuations and liquidity risk. Changes to Griffin's policies with regard to the foregoing could adversely affect Griffin's financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including the recent comprehensive tax reform legislation, could have an adverse impact on Griffin's business and financial results.. The United States recently enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") that includes significant changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of business entities. These changes include, among others, a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, an expansion of the bonus depreciation provisions relating to the deductibility of certain eligible capital expenses, a limitation on the utilization of net operating losses to offset taxable income, and a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense. Griffin is currently evaluating the potential impact of the TCJA on its operations. The impact of the TCJA could be material to Griffin's results of operations in future periods.. Risks Related to Griffin's Common Stock. Issuances of Griffin's common stock or the perception that such issuances might occur could adversely affect the per share trading price of Griffin's common stock.. The issuance of Griffin common stock in connection with future property, portfolio or business acquisitions, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate purposes could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of Griffin's common stock and would be dilutive to existing stockholders.  Griffin's Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval.
