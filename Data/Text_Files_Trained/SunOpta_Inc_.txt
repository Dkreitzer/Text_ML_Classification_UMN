[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and elsewhere in this report. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all possible risks or uncertainties applicable to our business. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report and in the other documents that we file from time to time with the SEC and the CSA.. Risks Related to Our Value Creation Plan, Significant Investors and Shareholder Activism. The implementation of our Value Creation Plan could pose a number of risks that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following our strategic partnership with Oaktree, we conducted a thorough review of our operations, management and governance, with the objective of maximizing our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As a product of this review, our management and the Board developed a Value Creation Plan built on four pillars: portfolio optimization, operational excellence, go-to-market effectiveness and process sustainability. The Value Creation Plan is a broad-based initiative focused on increasing shareholder value through strategic investments made to the people and assets of the Company to deliver sustained profitable growth. We expect the Value Creation Plan to be implemented in phases, and span several years. In connection with the Value Creation Plan, we are implementing a number of operational actions to improve our profitability and streamline our operations for long-term success. These actions may include rationalization or consolidation of certain of our operations or facilities, reinvestment in certain of our operations or facilities, investments in personnel, processes and tools, as well as other cost saving initiatives. These actions could consume capital resources and could also give rise to impairment and other restructuring charges that would be both cash and non-cash in nature, and these charges could be material.. The implementation of the Value Creation Plan could have a material impact on our operations, strategy, governance, management and future prospects. For example, in 2016, we announced the closures of our San Bernardino, California, juice facility and Heuvelton, New York, soy extraction facility, resulting in impairment charges amounting to $13.2 million. Similarly, in 2017, we announced the exits from flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations, as well as the consolidation of our roasted snack operations, resulting in impairment charges of $18.2 million relating to these assets. Certain actions that we take may lead to additional write-downs of assets and/or charges in future periods. In addition, we cannot predict whether the actions we take will achieve our goals of improving our profitability and financial performance and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. The ongoing implementation of our Value Creation Plan could expose us to a number of other risks, including the following:. <U+0095>              distraction of management;                           <U+0095>              difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key       personnel as a result of uncertainty generated by the review and the       implementation of any resulting recommendations;. SUNOPTA INC.          17      December 30, 2017 10-K. <U+0095>              difficulties in maintaining relationships or arrangements       with customers, suppliers and other third parties; and                           <U+0095>              increases in general and administrative expenses       associated with the need to retain and compensate business and recruiting       consultants and other advisors.. The occurrence of any one or more of the above risks could have an adverse impact on our business, financial results, liquidity and financial condition.. Our significant investors may have interests that conflict with those of our debtholders and other stakeholders. As at December 30, 2017, Oaktree held a 19.8% voting interest in the Company through its holdings of 11,333,333 special voting shares and 8,092,699 common shares of the Company. Oaktree has also nominated two members of the Board and is entitled to designate two nominees for election to the Board so long as it beneficially owns or controls at least 11.1% of SunOpta Inc.'s common stock on an as-exchanged basis. If Oaktree beneficially owns or controls less than 11.1% but more than 5% of SunOpta Inc.'s common stock on an as-exchanged basis, it will be entitled to designate one nominee. In addition, Engaged Capital has nominated one member of our Board.. Oaktree is assisting us with our efforts to improve our operations, management and governance. Oaktree's objectives and perspectives as an equity investor in SunOpta may not always be aligned with those of other stakeholders, including our debtholders and smaller shareholders.. The interests of Oaktree and Engaged Capital, as well as their affiliates, may differ from the interests of our other stakeholders in material respects. For example, our large investors and their affiliates may have an interest in directly or indirectly pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their other equity investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to us, including risks to our liquidity and financial condition. Our large investors and their affiliates are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies, including businesses that may directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. They may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.. A concentration of ownership within our large investors could potentially be disadvantageous to, or conflict with, interests of our debtholders or smaller shareholders. In addition, if any significant shareholder were to sell or otherwise transfer all or a large percentage of its holdings, we could find it difficult to raise capital, if needed, through the sale of additional equity securities.. Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of shareholder activism or an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest. In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. If a proxy contest or an unsolicited takeover proposal was made with respect to us, we could incur significant costs in defending the Company, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Shareholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and divert the attention of our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.. Risks Related to Our Business. Product liability suits, recalls and threatened market withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our products are susceptible to harmful bacteria, and the sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury or illness to consumers. Such injuries may result from inadvertent mislabeling, tampering by unauthorized third parties, faulty packaging materials, product contamination, or spoilage. Under certain circumstances, we or our customers may be required to recall or withdraw products, which may lead to a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. Our customers may also voluntarily recall or withdraw a product we manufactured or packaged, even without consulting us, which could increase our potential liability and costs and result in lost sales.  A product recall or withdrawal could result in significant losses due to the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time.  In addition, a recall or withdrawal may cause us to lose future revenues from, or relationships with, one or more material customers, and the impact of the recall or withdrawal could affect our customersâ<U+0080><U+0099> willingness to continue to purchase related or unrelated products from us, or could otherwise hinder our ability to grow our business with those customers.  We could also be forced to temporarily close one or more production facilities.. SUNOPTA INC.          18      December 30, 2017 10-K. For example, on May 3, 2016, we announced a voluntary recall of   certain sunflower kernel products that have the potential to be contaminated   with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria, and a number of our customers initiated   recalls of their products that contain the affected sunflower kernels as an   ingredient or component. Additionally, we ceased production at our roasting   facilities for the period from April 21, 2016 until on or about May 15, 2016,   while we put in place corrective and preventive actions. While we have   recognized estimated losses of $47.5 million related to this recall, we may need   to revise our estimates to be materially larger as we continue to work with our   customers to substantiate the claims received to date and any additional claims   that may be received. Consequently, we may not be able to determine the full   extent of the losses related to the recall for some time and certain factors   impacting these losses, such as our customers' processes for developing their   claims, the timing of submission of any such claims, and the terms of our   customers' insurance policies and related coverage, which are beyond our   control. Revisions of our estimated losses and costs may occur at any time as we continue this process.. We have general liability and product recall insurance policies with aggregate limits of $47.0 million under which we expect to recover the sunflower kernel recall-related costs, less applicable deductibles. As at December 30, 2017, we had recognized recoveries up to the limit of the coverage available under our insurance policies. Consequently, to the extent any losses are excluded under the insurance policies or additional losses are recognized related to existing or new claims, these excluded or excess losses will be recognized as a charge to future earnings.. Even if a situation does not necessitate a recall or market withdrawal, product liability claims might be asserted against us. If a product recall or withdrawal were to lead to a decline in sales of a similar or related product sold by a customer or other third party, that party could also initiate litigation against us. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities and those of our co-packers comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, if the consumption of any of our products causes, or is alleged to have caused, a health-related illness in the future, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image.. Moreover, future claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. Further, we may incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a further product recall could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses caused by third parties could harm our business. Our internal processes and training may not be fully effective in preventing contamination of food products that could lead to food-borne illnesses. We rely on third-party suppliers and distributors, which increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents (such as e. coli, salmonella or listeria) could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations. If consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products or organic products generally, even in the absence of a recall or a product liability case, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Instances of food-borne illnesses, whether real or perceived, and whether or not traceable to our operations or a result of our actions or omissions, could cause negative publicity about us or the products we serve, which could adversely affect sales. Food safety concerns and instances of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by contaminated products sold by third parties could cause customers to shift their preferences, even if no food-borne illnesses or injuries are traced to our products. As a result, our sales may decline. Loss of customers as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could harm our business.. Litigation and regulatory enforcement concerning marketing and labeling of food products could adversely affect our business and reputation. The marketing and labeling of any food product in recent years has brought increased risk that consumers will bring class action lawsuits and that the FTC and/or state attorneys general will bring legal action concerning the truth and accuracy of the marketing and labeling of the product. Examples of causes of action that may be asserted in a consumer class action lawsuit include fraud, unfair trade practices, and breach of state consumer protection statutes (such as Proposition 65 in California). The FTC and/or state attorneys general may bring legal action that seeks removal of a product from the marketplace, and impose fines and penalties. Even when not merited, class claims, action by the FTC or state attorneys general enforcement actions can be expensive to defend and adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. SUNOPTA INC.          19      December 30, 2017 10-K. We are subject to significant food and health regulations. We are affected by a wide range of governmental regulations in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and several countries in Europe, among others. These laws and regulations are implemented at the national level (including, among others, federal laws and regulation in Canada and the U.S.) and by local subdivisions (including, among others, state laws in the U.S. and provincial laws in Canada). We are also subject to regulations of the EU and the regulatory authority of regulatory agencies in several different countries. Examples of regulatory agencies influencing our operations include: the USDA, the FDA, the DHS, the EPA, the CFIA, and Skal, among others.. Examples of laws and regulations that affect us include laws and regulations applicable to:. <U+0095>      the use of seed, fertilizer and pesticides;                      <U+0095>      the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and       warehousing of seeds, grain and other products;                    <U+0095>      the processing and sale of food, including       wholesale operations; and                    <U+0095>      the product labeling and marketing of food and       food products, food safety and food defense.. These laws and regulations affect various aspects of our business. For example, certain food ingredient products manufactured by SunOpta may require pre-market approval by the FDA that the ingredient is generally recognized as safe, or \"GRAS.\" We believe that most food ingredients for which we have commercial rights are GRAS. However, this status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. As a result, we may be adversely impacted if the FDA determines that our food ingredient products do not meet the criteria for GRAS.. In addition, certain USDA regulations set forth the minimum standards producers must meet in order to have their products labeled as \"certified organic\", and we currently manufacture a number of organic products that are covered by these regulations. While we believe our products and our supply chain are in compliance with these regulations, changes to food regulations may increase our costs to remain in compliance. We could lose our \"organic\" certification if a facility becomes contaminated with non-organic materials or if we do not use raw materials that are certified organic. The loss of our \"organic\" certifications could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is subject to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\"PACA\"). PACA regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs our purchases of fresh produce and sales of frozen produce. We source fresh produce under licenses issued by the USDA, as required by PACA. Our failure to comply with the PACA requirements could, among other things, result in civil penalties, suspension or revocation of our licenses to sell produce and in certain cases, criminal prosecution, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in any government laws and regulations applicable to our operations could increase our compliance costs, negatively affect our ability to sell certain products or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while we believe we are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations, we cannot assure you that we have been, or will at all times be, in compliance with all food production and health requirements, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements. Our failure to comply with any laws, regulations or policies applicable to our business could result in fines, lawsuits, enforcement actions, penalties or loss in the ability to sell certain products, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. SUNOPTA INC.          20      December 30, 2017 10-K. We may require additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. We have grown via a combination of internal growth and acquisitions requiring available financial resources. Our ability to raise capital, through equity or debt financing, is directly related to our ability to both continue to grow and improve returns from our operations. Debt or equity financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, any future equity financing would dilute our current shareholders and may result in a decrease in our share price if we are unable to realize adequate returns. We will not be able to continue to fund internal growth and/or acquire complementary businesses within the natural and organic food industries without continued access to capital resources.. SUNOPTA INC.          21      December 30, 2017 10-K. Impairment charges in goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. As a result of business acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets is comprised of intangible assets and goodwill. We are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of these assets. We may engage in additional acquisitions, which could result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill. If the financial performance of the acquired businesses is not as strong as we anticipate, we could be required to record significant impairments to intangible assets and/or goodwill, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.. For example, in 2017, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $115.0 million related to the Healthy Fruit reporting unit of the Consumer Products operating segment, and, in 2016, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $17.5 million related to the Sunflower reporting unit of the Raw Material Sourcing and Supply operating segment.. We operate in a highly competitive industry. We operate businesses in highly competitive product and geographic markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and various other international markets. We compete with various U.S. and international commercial grain procurement marketers, major companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient companies, trading companies, and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients and other food companies involved in natural and organic foods. These competitors may have financial resources and staff larger than ours and may be able to benefit from economies of scale, pricing advantages and greater resources to launch new products that compete with our offerings. We have little control over and cannot otherwise affect these competitive factors. If we are unable to effectively respond to these competitive factors or if the competition in any of our product markets results in price reductions or decreased demand for our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.. Our customers generally are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us. Many of our customers buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products. We cannot provide assurance that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base. Decreases in our customers' sales volumes or orders for products supplied by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Loss of a key customer could materially reduce revenues and earnings. Our relationships with our key customers are critical to the success of our business and our results of operations. Our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of revenues for the year ended December 30, 2017. The loss, decrease or cancellation of business with any of our large customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Consumer preferences for natural and organic food products are difficult to predict and may change. Our success depends, in part, on our ability and our customers' ability to offer products that anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and appeal to their preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or products that utilize our integrated foods platform, or a failure to maintain our current market position, could reduce our sales and harm our business. Consumer trends change based on a number of factors, including nutritional values, a change in consumer preferences or general economic conditions. Additionally, there is a growing focus among some consumers to buy local food products in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food products from longer distances, which could result in a decrease in the demand for food products and ingredients that we import from other countries or transport from remote processing locations or growing regions. Further, failures by us or our competitors to deliver quality products could erode consumer trust in the organic certification of foods. These changes could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price decreases, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. SUNOPTA INC.          22      December 30, 2017 10-K. If we do not manage our supply chain effectively, our operating results may be adversely affected. Our supply chain is complex. We rely on suppliers for our raw materials and for the manufacturing, processing, packaging and distribution of many of our products. The inability of any of these suppliers to deliver or perform for us in a timely or cost-effective manner could cause our operating costs to rise and our margins to fall. Many of our products are perishable and require timely processing and transportation to our customers. Additionally, many of our products can only be stored for a limited amount of time before they spoil and cannot be sold. We must continuously monitor our inventory and product mix against forecasted demand or risk having inadequate supplies to meet consumer demand as well as having too much inventory that may reach its expiration date. If we are unable to manage our supply chain efficiently and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, our operating costs could increase and our margins could fall, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Some of our operations are subject to seasonal supply fluctuations. For example, we purchase strawberries and other fruit from farmers during the peak California growing season, which occurs during the first two quarters of the year. As a result, our costs may be higher during these periods. We may not be successful in counteracting or smoothing out the effects of seasonality, and we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to remain subject to significant seasonality.. Part of our supply source also depends in part on a seasonal temporary workforce comprised primarily of migrant workers. Changes in immigration laws or policies that discourage migration to the U.S. and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that make it more difficult for individuals to immigrate to or migrate throughout the U.S. could adversely affect the migrant worker population and reduce the workforce available for farms and production facilities in the U.S. Additionally, increased competition from other industries for migrant workers could increase our costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and energy could increase our cost of sales and reduce our gross margins. Raw materials represent a significant portion of our cost of sales. Our cost to purchase services and materials, such as grains, fruits and other commodities, processing aids, and natural gas, can fluctuate depending on many factors, including weather patterns, economic and political conditions and pricing volatility. In addition, we must compete for limited supplies of these raw materials and services with competitors having greater resources than us. If our cost of materials and services increases due to any of the above factors, we may not be able to pass along the increased costs to our customers.. We enter into a number of exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts to partially hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations. Futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges. Our inventories, however, may not be completely hedged, due in part to our assessment of exposure from expected price fluctuations and an inability to hedge a number of raw materials.. Exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risks that a counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation. We may be unable to hedge 100% of the price risk of each transaction due to timing and availability of hedge contracts and third-party credit risk. In addition, we have a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the commodity as scheduled. We also monitor the prices of natural gas and from time to time lock in a percentage of our natural gas needs based on current prices and expected trends.. An increase in our cost of sales resulting from an increase in the price of raw materials and energy could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our future results of operations may be adversely affected by the availability of organic and non-GMO ingredients. Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of organic and non-GMO ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow organic and non-GMO crops, climate conditions, changes in national and world economic conditions, currency fluctuations and forecasting adequate need of seasonal ingredients.. The organic and non-GMO ingredients that we use in the production of our products (including, among others, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains) are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, water scarcity, temperature extremes, frosts, earthquakes and pestilences. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients or increase the prices of organic or non-GMO ingredients. If our supplies of organic or non-GMO ingredients are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms, if at all, which could impact our ability to supply product to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. SUNOPTA INC.          23      December 30, 2017 10-K. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could impose costs on our business. Our various food products, from seeds and grains to ingredients, fruits, vegetables and other inputs, are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including windstorms, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires, temperature extremes and earthquakes, some of which are common but difficult to predict, as well as crop disease and infestation. Severe weather conditions may occur with higher frequency or may be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions could reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters may adversely affect our supply of one or more food products or prevent or impair our ability to ship products as planned. These factors can increase costs, decrease our sales volumes and revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A significant portion of our fruit supply is sourced from California, which experienced severe drought conditions between fall 2011 and fall 2015 due to extremely low levels of rainfall. Such conditions resulted in lost crops as well as increased water costs for growers in California. In particular, we depend on growers in California for strawberries. In January 2014, a drought state of emergency was declared in California and, among other actions, legislation was passed requiring monitoring of groundwater pumping, which limits the amount of groundwater for which farmers can drill. Strawberry growers are largely dependent on well water, and diminishing groundwater resources could lead to a reduced strawberry supply. In April 2015, statewide mandatory water conservation measures were imposed in California, including increased water use reporting by agricultural water users, enhancing the state's ability to enforce against diversions and unreasonable use of water in an effort to curtail wasteful water practices in agricultural fields. Precipitation returned to more normal levels in 2016 and early 2017, and the drought emergency was lifted in April 2017. However, drought conditions are a recurring feature of California's climate, and existing and future water conservation laws could negatively impact the agricultural industry in California and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. An interruption at one or more of our manufacturing facilities could negatively affect our business, and our business continuity plan may prove inadequate. We own or lease, manage and operate a number of manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage and office facilities. We may be unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of disasters, epidemics, business interruptions or other similar events. Some of our inventory and manufacturing facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather, and the production of certain of our products is concentrated in a few geographic areas. In addition, we store chemicals used in the equipment for quick freezing of fruit or used for cooling processes during ingredient processing, and our storage of these chemicals could lead to risk of leaks, explosions or other events. Although we have a business continuity plan, we cannot provide assurance that our business continuity plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of any of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or epidemics prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we fail to maintain our labor force at one or more of our facilities, we could experience delays in production or delivery of our products, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Technology failures could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business. In the normal course of business, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. For example, our production and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and limit costs. Information technology systems are also integral to the reporting of our results of operations. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communications between, and storage of personal data of, our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, as a result of updating our enterprise platform or due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and other security issues. These events could compromise our confidential information, impede or interrupt our business operations, and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, litigation and reputational damage.. SUNOPTA INC.          24      December 30, 2017 10-K. Our reputation and our relationships with customers, consumers and suppliers would be harmed if our systems are accessed by unauthorized persons. We maintain certain personal data, including personal data regarding our personnel, customers, consumers and suppliers. This data is maintained on our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. If a breach or other breakdown results in disclosure of confidential or personal information, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm. While we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other preventive actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, they may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. Any data breach or other access of our systems by unauthorized persons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in laws and regulations of privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business. We are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally-identifying information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is constantly evolving and increasingly demanding. The restrictions imposed by such laws continue to develop and may require us to incur substantial costs, adopt additional compliance measures, such as notification requirements and corrective actions in the event of a security breach, and/or change our current or planned business models. We are already subject to strict data privacy laws in the European Union and other jurisdictions governing the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and personally-identifying information. The General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), coming into effect in Europe in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for non-compliance and extends the scope of the European Union data protection law to all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of the company's location. The GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Such regulations increase our compliance and administrative burden significantly. While we have developed and are executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements and do not currently foresee significant obstacles that would prevent timely compliance, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect implementation.. If our current security measures and data protection policies and controls are found to be non-compliant with relevant laws or regulations in any jurisdiction where we conduct business, we may be subject to penalties and fines, and may need to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures. In addition, we may be required to modify the features and functionality of our system offerings in a way that is less attractive to customers.. If we lose the services of our key management, our business could suffer. Our prospects depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our key executives, and our continued growth depends on our ability to identify, recruit and retain key management personnel. We are also dependent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our personnel. We do not typically carry key person life insurance on our executive officers. If we lose the services of our key management or fail to identify, recruit and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our results of operations and our growth could be adversely affected. Labor is a significant component of the cost of operating our business. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors, such as employment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we fail to increase our wages competitively, the quality of our workforce could decline, while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease. If we face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees from our competitors and other industries, higher employee-turnover rates, unionization of farm workers or increases in the federal- or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers' compensation insurance), our operating expenses could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. SUNOPTA INC.          25      December 30, 2017 10-K. Technological innovation by our competitors could make our food products less competitive. Our competitors include major food ingredient and consumer-packaged food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food and food ingredients. Many of these companies are engaged in the development of food ingredients and other packaged food products and frequently introduce new products into the market. Existing products or products under development by our competitors could prove to be more effective or less costly than our products, which could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness of our products and our business.. We rely on protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions.. Our trademarks and brand names are registered in the U.S., Canada and other jurisdictions. We intend to keep these filings current and seek protection for new trademarks to the extent consistent with business needs. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain of the technologies and processes that we use.. The failure of any patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to provide protection to our technologies would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products, which could result in lower sales or gross margins.. Changes in laws or regulations governing foreign trade or taxation could adversely affect our business. Changes in governmental laws or regulations affecting foreign trade or taxation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. Such changes could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.. The current President of the United States has expressed an intention to change existing trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). Any changes to NAFTA could impact our Mexican and Canadian operations. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade with countries where we or our customers operate, in particular Canada, Mexico and Europe, could adversely affect our operating results and our business.. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The U.S. recently enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.. Our operations are influenced by agricultural policies. We are affected by governmental agricultural policies such as price supports and acreage set aside programs and these types of policies may affect our business. The production levels, markets and prices of the grains and other raw products that we use in our business are materially affected by government programs, which include acreage control and price support programs of the USDA. Revisions in these and other comparable programs, in the U.S. and elsewhere, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.. We are subject to substantial environmental regulation and policies. We are, and expect to continue to be, subject to substantial federal, state, provincial and local environmental regulation. Some of the key environmental regulations to which we are subject include air quality regulations of the EPA and certain city, state and provincial air pollution control groups, waste treatment/disposal regulations, sewer regulations under agreements with local city sewer districts, regulations governing hazardous substances, storm water regulations and bioterrorism regulations. For a more detailed summary of the environmental regulations and policies to which we are subject, see \"Item 1. Business - Regulation\" of this report. Our business also requires that we have certain permits from various state, provincial and local authorities related to air quality, storm water discharge, solid waste, land spreading and hazardous waste.. SUNOPTA INC.          26      December 30, 2017 10-K. In the event that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of potentially hazardous materials in certain of our businesses were to fail, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such  liability could exceed our resources. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. In addition, changes to environmental regulations may require us to modify our existing plant and processing facilities and could significantly increase the cost of those operations.. The foregoing environmental regulations, as well as others common to the industries in which we participate, can present delays and costs that can adversely affect business development and growth. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any changes to current regulations may impact the development, manufacturing and marketing of our products, and may have a negative impact on our future results.. Climate change laws could have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S., Canada and internationally will likely continue to consider numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. In order to produce, manufacture and distribute our products, we and our suppliers use fuels, electricity and various other inputs that result in the release of greenhouse gas emissions. Concerns about the environmental impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change may result in environmental taxes, charges, regulatory schemes, assessments or penalties, which could restrict or negatively impact our operations, as well as those of our suppliers, who would likely pass all or a portion of their costs along to us. We may not be able to pass any resulting cost increases along to our customers. Any laws or regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change laws enacted by the U.S., Canada or any other international jurisdiction where we conduct business could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. We are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as our non-U.S.-based operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes and we also sell product in currencies that are different from the currency used to purchase materials, or process finished goods. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. We are exposed to price fluctuations on a number of commodities as we hold inventory and enter into transactions to buy and sell products in a number of markets. Additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about these risks can be found in \"Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" of this report. As a result of these exposures, fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.. Our international operations expose us to additional risks. We source our products from numerous suppliers and growers from around the world. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, we have processing, packaging and warehousing facilities in Mexico, Europe, Africa and Asia. Our international operations and customers expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:. <U+0095>             exposure to local economic conditions, expropriation and       nationalization, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;                                 <U+0095>             withholding and other taxes on remittances and other       payments by subsidiaries;                           <U+0095>             investment restrictions or requirements;                           <U+0095>             export and import restrictions;                           <U+0095>             compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws,       including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;                           <U+0095>             compliance with export controls and economic sanctions       laws;. SUNOPTA INC.          27      December 30, 2017 10-K. <U+0095>             increases in working capital requirements related to long       supply chains; and                          <U+0095>             disruptions in our supply chain from unforeseen events,       such as natural disasters, terrorism and political and civil unrest.. For example, we have significant operations in Mexico, including a facility in the State of Michoacán, near areas where there have been incidents of unrest, which may heighten the risks of our international operations described above.. As we continue to expand our business globally, we may have difficulty anticipating and effectively managing these and other risks that our international operations may face, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any acquisition of businesses with operations outside of the U.S. and Canada may exacerbate this risk.. A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S.; it may be difficult to effect service of process and enforce legal judgments upon us and certain of our executive officers and directors. A significant portion of our assets and certain of our executive officers and directors are located outside of the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the U.S. and enforce judgment of a U.S. court obtained against us or our executive officers and directors. Particularly, our stakeholders may not be able to:. <U+0095>             effect service of process within the U.S. on us or       certain of our executive officers and directors;                          <U+0095>             enforce judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or       certain of our executive officers and directors based upon the civil       liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws;                          <U+0095>             enforce, in a court outside of the U.S., judgments of       U.S. courts based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal       securities laws; or                          <U+0095>             bring an original action in a court outside of the U.S.       to enforce liabilities against us or any of our executive officers and       directors based upon the U.S. federal securities laws.. Risks Related to Our Indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, without limitation, impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes. In addition, we will have to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal, premium (if any) and interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Our level of indebtedness will also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions, and may compromise our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures as compared to our competitors.. Our debt and equity agreements restrict how we may operate our business, and our business may be materially and adversely affected if these restrictions prevent us from implementing our business plan. The agreements governing our debt and preferred equity instruments contain restrictive covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to obtain additional debt financing, to create other liens, to complete a merger, amalgamation or consolidation, to make certain distributions or make certain payments, investments and guarantees and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets. These restrictions may hinder our ability to execute on our growth strategy or prevent us from implementing parts of our business plan.. SUNOPTA INC.          28      December 30, 2017 10-K. Our business may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to renew the Global Credit Facility and/or refinance our senior secured second lien notes. The Global Credit Facility matures on February 10, 2021. We may not be able to renew this facility to the same level or size, or on terms as favorable as at present. A reduced facility may impact our ability to finance our business, requiring us to scale back our operations and our use of working capital. Alternatively, obtaining credit on less favorable terms would have a direct impact on our profitability and operating flexibility. Our senior secured second lien notes mature on October 9, 2022. Our ability to refinance these notes upon maturity will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. As a result, we may not be able to obtain refinancing at commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital.. Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to meet the financial covenants of the Global Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants under the Global Credit Facility agreement will depend on the success of our businesses, our operating results, and our ability to achieve our financial forecasts. Various risks uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with the financial covenants and terms of the Global Credit Facility agreement. Failure to comply with our financial covenants and other terms could result in an event of default and the acceleration of amounts owing under this agreement, unless we are able to negotiate a waiver. The lenders could condition any such waiver on an amendment to the agreement on terms (including, but not limited to, the payment of consent fees) that may be unfavorable to us. If we are unable to negotiate a covenant waiver or replace or refinance the Global Credit Facility agreement on favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted.. Risks Related to Business Acquisitions and Divestures. We may not be able to effectively manage our growth and integrate acquired companies. From time to time we may pursue acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our overall growth strategy. In October 2015, for example, we completed the acquisition of Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc., which was the largest acquisition in the history of our company. Our ability to effectively integrate past or future business acquisitions, including our ability to realize potentially available marketing opportunities and cost savings in a timely and efficient manner will have a direct impact on our future results. We may encounter problems in connection with the integration of any new businesses, such as challenges relating to the following:. <U+0095>      integration of an acquired company's products       into our product mix;                    <U+0095>      the amount of cost savings that may be realized       as a result of integrating an acquired product or business;                    <U+0095>      unanticipated quality and production issues       with acquired products;                    <U+0095>      adverse effects on business relationships with       suppliers and customers;                    <U+0095>      diversion of management attention;                    <U+0095>      integrating acquired operations that have       management teams and company cultures that differ from our own;                    <U+0095>      difficulty with personnel and loss of key       employees;                   <U+0095>      implementation of an integrated enterprise-wide       accounting and information system and consolidation of back office       accounting;                    <U+0095>      compatibility of financial control and       information systems;                    <U+0095>      exchange rate risk with respect to acquisitions       outside the U.S.;. SUNOPTA INC.          29      December 30, 2017 10-K. <U+0095>             potential for patent and trademark claims or other       litigation against or involving the acquired company;                          <U+0095>             integration of businesses that operate in new geographic       areas, including difficulties in identifying and gaining access to       customers in new markets; and                          <U+0095>             in the case of foreign acquisitions, uncertainty       regarding foreign laws and regulations and difficulty integrating       operations and systems as a result of cultural, systems and operational       differences.. If we experience any of these problems in the integration of acquisitions, they could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may not have accurately estimated the benefits or synergies to be realized from business acquisitions. Our expected benefits and synergies from acquired businesses may not be realized if our cash flow estimates associated with the assets of those businesses are materially inaccurate or if we fail to identify operating problems or liabilities prior to acquisition. We perform inspections of the assets to be acquired, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. However, the accuracy of our assessments of the assets and our estimates are inherently uncertain. There could also be environmental or other problems that were not discovered in the course of our due diligence and inspections. If problems or risks are identified after the closing of an acquisition, there may be limited recourse against the former owners.. Business acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities. When we acquire a business, we often assume or otherwise become subject to liabilities of acquired businesses, including contingent liabilities that may depend on the outcome of legal and administrative proceedings or other events. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities that are unknown to us or that cannot be quantified at the time of the acquisition. If we become subject to significant liabilities or other obligations as a result of an acquisition, our business could be materially affected. Moreover, to the extent we have contractual rights to indemnification against losses and liabilities of businesses we acquire, the amount of indemnification available could be limited and may not be sufficient to cover the actual losses we suffer.. Business acquisitions could result in unexpected disruptions of our business. In response to an acquisition, the customers may cease or reduce their business with the combined company, which could negatively affect our business. Similarly, current or prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, marketing and technical personnel. In addition, the diversion of the attention of our respective management teams away from day-to-day operations during the pendency of the business acquisition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.. The possible future divestiture of businesses could impact our profitability. We may, from time to time, divest businesses that are no longer a strategic fit or no longer meet our growth or profitability targets. Our profitability may be impacted by gains or losses on the sales of such businesses, or lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. Additionally, we may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to divested businesses, or indemnify buyers for liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. For example, in 2017 and 2016, we recognized asset impairment and facility closure costs of $33.3 million, as well as related employee termination costs of $8.4 million, in connection with portfolio optimization measures taken under the Value Creation Plan, including the exits from flexible resealable pouch and nutrition bar product lines and operations. We may also not be able to negotiate such divestitures on terms acceptable to us. Such potential divestitures will require management resources and may divert management's attention from our day-to-day operations. If we are not successful in divesting such businesses, our business could be harmed.. Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Shares. Our operating results and share price are subject to significant volatility. Our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to:. <U+0095>      changes in our customers and/or their demand;. SUNOPTA INC.          30      December 30, 2017 10-K. <U+0095>      changes in our operating expenses;                    <U+0095>      management's ability to execute our business       strategies focused on improved operating earnings;                    <U+0095>      organizational and personnel changes;                    <U+0095>      interruption in operations at our facilities;                        <U+0095>      product recalls or market withdrawals;                   <U+0095>      legal and administrative cases (whether civil,       such as environmental or product related, or criminal), settlements,       judgments and investigations;                    <U+0095>      foreign currency fluctuations;                    <U+0095>      supply shortages or commodity price       fluctuations; and                    <U+0095>      general economic conditions.. In addition, our share price may be highly volatile compared to larger public companies. Certain announcements could have a significant effect on our share price, including announcements regarding:. <U+0095>      fluctuations in financial performance from       period to period;                    <U+0095>      mergers, acquisitions and/or divestitures,       either by us or key competitors;                    <U+0095>      changes in key personnel;                    <U+0095>      strategic partnerships or arrangements;                    <U+0095>      litigation and governmental inquiries;                    <U+0095>      changes in governmental regulation and policy;                        <U+0095>      patents or proprietary rights;                    <U+0095>      changes in consumer preferences and demand;                      <U+0095>      new financings; and                    <U+0095>      general market conditions.. Higher volatility increases the chance of larger than normal price swings which reduces predictability in the price of our common shares and could impair investment decisions. In addition, price and volume trading volatility in the stock markets can have a substantial effect on our share price, frequently for reasons other than our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.. Periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, is often followed by securities class action litigation alleging material misstatements or omissions in disclosures provided to shareholders. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.. Our debt instruments restrict, and our future debt instruments may restrict, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, and we do not currently intend to pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future; therefore, our shareholders may not be able to receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold. We have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common shares. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future because, among other reasons, we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business. In addition, the covenants included in our debt instruments, and the covenants to be included in our future debt instruments may restrict our ability to receive cash from our subsidiaries and pay dividends on our common shares. The future payment of dividends will be dependent on factors such as these covenant restrictions, cash on hand, or achieving and maintaining profitability, the financial requirements to fund growth, our general financial condition and other factors the Board may consider appropriate in the circumstances. Until we pay dividends, which we may never do, our shareholders will not receive a return on their common shares until their shares are sold.. SUNOPTA INC.          31      December 30, 2017 10-K. The future issuance of additional common shares in connection with the exchange of convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock options, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities could dilute the value of our common shares. We have unlimited common shares authorized but unissued. Our articles of amalgamation authorize us to issue these common shares, and we may also issue options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to common shares for consideration and on terms and conditions established by the Board in its sole discretion.. The exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan, and issuance of additional securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise could result in dilution in the value of our common shares and the voting power represented thereby. Furthermore, to the extent common shares are issued pursuant to the exchange of outstanding convertible preferred stock, exercise of stock-based awards, participation in our employee stock purchase plan and issuance of additional securities, our share price may decrease due to the additional amount of common shares available in the market. The subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales by our shareholders and others, which could place further downward pressure on our share price. Moreover, the holders of our stock options may hedge their positions in our common shares by short selling our common shares, which could further adversely affect our stock price.. If securities or industry research analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common shares, our share price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common shares relies in part on the research and reports that securities and industry research analysts publish about us, our industry, our competitors and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. Our share price and trading volumes could decline if one or more securities or industry analysts downgrade our common shares, issue unfavorable commentary about us, our industry or our business, cease to cover our Company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, our industry or our business."
