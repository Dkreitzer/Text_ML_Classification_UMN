[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. Readers and prospective investors in the Company's securities should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report.. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that Management is not aware of or focused on or that Management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company's business operations. This Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company's financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the company's securities could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment in the Company's common stock.. Market and Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates could reduce income and cash flow.. The discussion in this Report under \"Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Asset, Liability and Market Risk Management\" and \"- Liquidity and Funding\" and \"Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" is incorporated by reference in this paragraph. The Company's income and cash flow depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings, and the Company's success in competing for loans and deposits. The Company cannot control or prevent changes in the level of interest rates which fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Open Market Committee of the FRB, and pricing practices of the Company's competitors. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and other borrowings, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits and other liabilities.. -9-. Changes in capital market conditions could reduce asset valuations.. Capital market conditions, including liquidity, investor confidence, bond issuer credit worthiness, perceived counter-party risk, the supply of and demand for financial instruments, the financial strength of market participants, and other factors can materially impact the value of the Company's assets. An impairment in the value of the Company's assets could result in asset write-downs, reducing the Company's asset values, earnings, and equity.. The value of securities in the Company's investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets. The market for some of the investment securities held in the Company's portfolio can be extremely volatile. Volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to loss recognition that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's net income and capital levels.. The weakness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Company's counterparty or client. In addition, the Company's credit risk may be increased when the collateral the Company holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations or earnings.. Shares of Company common stock eligible for future sale or grant of stock options could have a dilutive effect on the market for Company common stock and could adversely affect the market price.. The Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize the issuance of 150 million shares of common stock (and two additional classes of 1 million shares each, denominated \"Class B Common Stock\" and \"Preferred Stock\", respectively) of which approximately 26.4 million shares of common stock were outstanding at December 31, 2017. Pursuant to its stock option plans, at December 31, 2017, the Company had outstanding options for 1.0 million shares of common stock, of which 469 thousand were currently exercisable. As of December 31, 2017, 930 thousand shares of Company common stock remained available for grants under the Company's stock option plans. Sales of substantial amounts of Company common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of its common stock.. The Company's payment of dividends on common stock could be eliminated or reduced.. Holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by the Company's Board of Directors. Although the Company has historically paid cash dividends on the Company's common stock, the Company is not required to do so and the Company's Board of Directors could reduce or eliminate the Company's common stock dividend in the future.. The Company could repurchase shares of its common stock at price levels considered excessive.. The Company repurchases and retires its common stock in accordance with Board of Directors-approved share repurchase programs. At December 31, 2017, approximately 1.8 million shares remained available to repurchase under such plans. The Company has been active in repurchasing and retiring shares of its common stock when alternative uses of excess capital, such as acquisitions, have been limited. The Company could repurchase shares of its common stock at price levels considered excessive, thereby spending more cash on such repurchases as deemed reasonable and effectively retiring fewer shares than would be retired if repurchases were effected at lower prices.. Risks Related to the Nature and Geographical Location of the Company's Business. The Company invests in loans that contain inherent credit risks that may cause the Company to incur losses.. The Company can provide no assurance that the credit quality of the loan portfolio will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect the Company.. -10-. The Company's operations are concentrated geographically in California, and poor economic conditions may cause the Company to incur losses.. Substantially all of the Company's business is located in California. A portion of the loan portfolio of the Company is dependent on real estate. At December 31, 2017, real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately 53% of the Company's loan portfolio. The Company's financial condition and operating results will be subject to changes in economic conditions in California. The California economy was severely affected by the recessionary period of 2008 to 2009. Much of the California real estate market experienced a decline in values of varying degrees. This decline had an adverse impact on the business of some of the Company's borrowers and on the value of the collateral for many of the Company's loans. Generally, the counties surrounding and near San Francisco Bay have recovered more soundly from the recent recession than counties in the California \"Central Valley,\" from Sacramento in the north to Bakersfield in the south. Approximately 22% of the Company's loans are to borrowers in the California \"Central Valley.\" Economic conditions in California's diverse geographic markets can be vastly different and are subject to various uncertainties, including the condition of the construction and real estate sectors, the effect of drought on the agricultural sector and its infrastructure, and the California state government's budgetary and fiscal condition. The Company can provide no assurance that conditions in any sector or geographic market of the California economy will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect the Company.. The markets in which the Company operates are subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire storms and other natural disasters.. All of the properties of the Company are located in California. Also, most of the real and personal properties which currently secure a majority of the Company's loans are located in California. Further, the Company invests in securities issued by companies and municipalities operating throughout the United States, and in mortgage-backed securities collateralized by real property located throughout the United States. California and other regions of the United States are prone to earthquakes, brush and forest fires, flooding, drought and other natural disasters. In addition to possibly sustaining uninsured damage to its own properties, if there is a major earthquake, flood, drought, fire or other natural disaster, the Company faces the risk that many of its debtors may experience uninsured property losses, or sustained business or employment interruption and/or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their debt obligations. A major earthquake, flood, prolonged drought, fire or other natural disaster in California or other regions of the United States could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. A sustained or continuing weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the Company does business could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on the Company's business:. ·a decrease                                          in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company;. ·an increase                                          or decrease in the usage of unfunded credit commitments;. ·an increase                                          or decrease in the amount of deposits;. ·a decrease                                          in non-depository funding available to the Company;. ·an impairment                                          of certain intangible assets, including goodwill;. ·an                                          increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for                                          protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the                                          Company, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs,                                          provision for loan losses, reduced interest revenue and cash flows, and valuation adjustments                                          on assets;. ·an impairment                                          in the value of investment securities;. ·an impairment                                          in the value of life insurance policies owned by the Company;. ·an impairment                                          in the value of real estate owned by the Company.. The 2008 - 2009 financial crisis led to the failure or merger of a number of financial institutions. Financial institution failures can result in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties. The failure of institutions with FDIC insured deposits can cause the DIF reserve ratio to decline, resulting in increased deposit insurance assessments on surviving FDIC insured institutions. Weak economic conditions can significantly weaken the strength and liquidity of financial institutions.. -11-. The Company's financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, are highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in the State of California and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, healthy labor markets, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: declines in economic growth, high rates of unemployment, deflation, declines in business activity or consumer, investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.. Such business conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company's loans, the demand for loans, loan volumes and related revenue, securities valuations, amounts of deposits, availability of funding, results of operations and financial condition.. Regulatory Risks. Restrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to the Company.. As a holding company, a substantial portion of the Company's cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by the Bank. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the Company's subsidiaries can pay to the Company without regulatory approval. The Bank obtained regulatory approval for dividends paid to the Company in 2017. A reduction in subsidiary dividends paid to the Company could limit the capacity of the Company to pay dividends. In addition, if any of the Company's subsidiaries were to liquidate, that subsidiary's creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before the Company, as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary, will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary.. Adverse effects of changes in banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect the Company.. The Company is subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision, which is primarily for the benefit and protection of the Company's customers and not for the benefit of investors. In the past, the Company's business has been materially affected by these regulations.. Laws, regulations or policies, including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting the Company and the Company's subsidiaries, may change at any time. Regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations. Therefore, the Company's business may be adversely affected by any future changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement including future acts of terrorism, major U.S. corporate bankruptcies and reports of accounting irregularities at U.S. public companies.. Additionally, the Company's business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. The Company is particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States of America. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings by depository institutions, (c) changing interest rates paid on balances financial institutions deposit with the FRB, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Under long- standing policy of the FRB, a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. As a result of that policy, the Company may be required to commit financial and other resources to its subsidiary bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so.. Following the most recent recession, the FRB has been providing vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system. The FRB has been purchasing large quantities of U.S. government securities, including agency-backed mortgage securities, increasing the demand for such securities thereby reducing interest rates. The FRB began reducing these asset purchase activities in the fourth quarter 2013 and the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") has been increasing the target range for the federal funds rate. On December 13, 2017, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¼ to 1½ percent, which could reduce liquidity in the markets and cause interest rates to rise, thereby increasing funding costs to the Bank, reducing the availability of funds to the Bank to finance its existing operations, and causing fixed-rate investment securities and loans to decline in value.. Federal and state governments could pass legislation detrimental to the Company's performance.. As an example, the Company could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the Bank's borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Company could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits or delays the Bank's ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible. Federal, state and local governments could pass tax legislation causing the Company to pay higher levels of taxes.. -12-. The FDIC insures deposits at insured financial institutions up to certain limits. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain adequate funding of the Deposit Insurance Fund.. The behavior of depositors in regard to the level of FDIC insurance could cause our existing customers to reduce the amount of deposits held at the Bank, and could cause new customers to open deposit accounts at the Bank. The level and composition of the Bank's deposit portfolio directly impacts the Bank's funding cost and net interest margin.. Systems, Accounting and Internal Control Risks. The accuracy of the Company's judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact operating results and financial condition.. The discussion under \"Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\" in this Report and the information referred to in that discussion is incorporated by reference in this paragraph. The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing its financial statements. The quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.. The Company's information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.. The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third party vendors and other service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company's data processing, accounting, customer relationship management and other systems. Communication and information systems failures can result from a variety of risks including, but not limited to, events that are wholly or partially out of the Company's control, such as telecommunication line integrity, weather, terrorist acts, natural disasters, accidental disasters, unauthorized breaches of security systems, energy delivery systems, cyber attacks, and other events. Although the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company's computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company and its customers, there is no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately corrected by the Company or its vendors. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could damage the Company's reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.. The Company's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. The Company maintains controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud, and maintains insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by the Company's internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of the Company's insurance limits or insurance underwriters' financial capacity. Any failure or circumvention of the Company's controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition."
