[1] "Item 1A. \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tRisk Factors. RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. A majority of our revenue comes from a small number of customers; if we lose any of these customers, our revenue could decline significantly.. We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace in which current and prospective customers often seek to lower their costs through a competitive bidding process among EMS providers. This process creates an opportunity to increase revenue to the extent we are successful in the bidding process, however, there is also the potential for revenue decline to the extent we are unsuccessful in the process. Furthermore, even if we are successful, there is the potential for our margins to decrease.. Our two largest customers each represented 11.9% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our top ten largest customers collectively represented 72.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. In addition to having a limited number of customers, we manufacture a limited number of products for each of our customers. If we lose any of our largest customers (as we have historically experienced in the past) or any product line manufactured for one of our largest customers, we would experience a significant reduction in our revenue. The insolvency of one or more of our largest customers or the inability of one or more of our largest customers to pay for its orders would decrease revenue significantly. A reduction in revenue can decrease our profitability and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are exposed to general economic conditions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.. As a result of unfavorable economic conditions, reduced capital spending and changes in our customers’ manufacturing requirements, our revenues have declined during each of the last three years. If general economic conditions deteriorate, we may experience an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, since end customer demand for our customers’ products could be adversely affected. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the economy and the Company’s ability to predict the effect such conditions will have on its customers, the Company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect that any economic slowdown may have on it.. We are exposed to fluctuations in currencies against the U.S dollar.. Most of our sales and component purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our Canadian, Mexican and Asian payroll, Euro based component purchases and other various expenses are denominated in local currencies. As a result, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange currency rate fluctuations related to the forecasted Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. The Company has decided at this time not to hedge exposure due to foreign exchange currency related to Euro component purchases or Asian payroll. To the extent we are not able to effectively manage this exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.. Our industry is very competitive and we may not be successful if we fail to compete effectively.. The EMS industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous large domestic and foreign EMS providers but consider our peer group and direct competitors to be IEC Electronics Corp., Key Tronic Corp., Nortech Systems Inc., Sigmatron International Inc., Sparton Corp. and Sypris Solutions Inc. We may in the future encounter competition from additional large electronics manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources and lower cost structures than us. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers, which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of using external manufacturers.. 14. We experience variability in our operating results, which could negatively impact the price of our shares.. Our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past. The reasons for these fluctuations may similarly impact our business in the future. Prospective investors should not rely solely on our results of operations in any past period to indicate what our results will be for any future period. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in the timing of shipments of products to customers; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintroduction and market acceptance of our customers’ new products;  \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in demand for our customers’ existing products;  \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe accuracy of our customers’ forecasts of future production requirements;  \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in customers and customer or product attrition; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teffectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes, inventory levels and costs; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers’ markets;  \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twillingness of suppliers to supply the Company on normal credit terms; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the cost, or availability, of components or skilled labor.. In addition, most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules more than 30 to 90 days in advance. Accordingly, it is difficult for us to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty. As a result, we may not be able to schedule production to maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing, purchase materials and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers. Sometimes anticipated orders from customers have failed to materialize and, at times, delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer’s needs. Any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from our larger customers could cause our revenue to decline. In addition, a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On other occasions, customers have required rapid and unexpected increases in production, which have placed burdens on our manufacturing capacity and supply chain function and adversely affected costs.. Any of these factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are dependent upon the industry sectors we service, which produce electronic products that are technologically advanced with short life cycles.. Most of our customers develop technologically advanced electronic products, which are characterized by intense competition, short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand. In addition, these products are generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence. If our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment, their products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could significantly decline. Our success is largely dependent on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. Furthermore, the electronics industry is subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced downturns. A decline in the industry demand for these products would likely have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Consolidation in the industry sectors we operate in may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power or increasing competition.. Consolidation in the industry sectors among our competitors, our customers, or both, may result in increasing or strengthening large electronics companies. The significant buying and market power of these companies may increase competitive pressures on us, which could negatively impact our margins. In addition, if any of our large customers are acquired or merged, we may lose that customer’s business.. Shortages or price fluctuations of component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability.. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing. In turnkey manufacturing, we provide both the materials and the manufacturing services. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs, scrap and excess inventory, all of which can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, delays, cancellations or reductions of orders by our customers could result in an excess of materials. Orders received from customers within component lead time, rapid increases in orders or lengthening of lead times by suppliers could cause a shortage of materials. A shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs. An excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence, both of which may increase expenses and decrease profit margins and operating income.. 15. Many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole-source suppliers. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production of all products using that component or cause cost increases in the services we provide. In addition, in the past, some of the materials we use, such as memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages. At such times, suppliers allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials required. Our inability to obtain these materials could slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, increase costs and reduce operating income. Also, we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases, which if we are not able to recover from our customers, could reduce our operating income. In addition, we rely on a variety of common carriers for materials transportation, and we route materials through various world ports. A work stoppage, strike or shutdown of a major port or airport could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and divestitures, which could harm our business.. We have completed acquisitions of businesses in the past and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings. Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and challenges, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention from the normal operation of our business;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcybersecurity and compliance related issues;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinitial dependence on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply chain partners; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.. In addition, divestitures involve significant risks, including without limitation, difficulty finding financially sufficient buyers or selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction. In addition, completing divestitures requires expenses and management attention and could leave us with certain continuing liabilities.. These and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or divestiture, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.. Volatility in the financial markets.. Our ability to obtain future financing or amend the existing terms of our current credit and long-term debt facilities on terms acceptable to us may be adversely impacted by the volatility of the credit markets. In addition, the volatility could negatively impact our customers, certain of their customers, and our suppliers. These impacts could lead to a decrease in demand for our services, as well as our customers’ products, or a decrease in supply of our inputs, which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations or in our customers having insufficient financing to support their business.. 16. If we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technology and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively.. The market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to develop and market services that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. In addition, the EMS industry could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services. We may not be able to effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market. To the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments. We may not be able to access capital for these purposes in the future and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable technological processes.. Cyber security incidents could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.. Our operations and systems could be interrupted by cyber security attacks. Such events could make it difficult to manufacture or deliver products to our customers due to our reliance on our systems in the day to day operations of our business. While we maintain security and back-up procedures to business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions.. If the products we manufacture are defective, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty claims.. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation, and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.. If a product or component we manufacture is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could incur significant expenditures to resolve any potential claims resulting from such damages or defects. In addition, any such claim could hurt our reputation or position in the marketplace, which could result in the loss of existing customers and our ability to attract new ones. A successful product liability or product warranty claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Although, generally, liability for these claims in our contracts rest with our customers, our customers may or may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility.. We are subject to the risk of increased taxes.. We base our tax position upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position, however, is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may assess additional tax or interest and penalties on such additional taxes.. Our business will suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees.. Our business depends on our ability to continue to recruit, train and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management, engineering and sales personnel. Recruiting personnel in our industry is highly competitive. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to attract and retain management and existing employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain, now or in the future, executive officers and key personnel. In addition, if we receive a significant volume of new orders at any one time, we may have difficulty recruiting skilled workers to respond to such orders and accordingly may experience delays that could adversely affect our ability to meet customers’ delivery schedules.. 17. Risks particular to our international manufacturing operations could adversely affect our overall results.. Our international manufacturing operations are subject to inherent risks, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting amounts receivable; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced credit and payment terms with vendors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in duties and taxation; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in international trade agreements; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; and \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrade restrictions.. In 2017, 84.9% of our revenue was earned from products that we manufactured internationally (outside of the U.S). Changes to laws, regulations or trade agreements in relation to Mexico or China could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws, which expose us to potential liability.. Our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. Compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. We may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused such release. In addition we may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, if such sites become contaminated, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws. In the event of a contamination or violation of environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages including fines, penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits. Any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby having an adverse effect on our operations. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.. Our industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons. Such changes, delays and cancellations may lead to our production and possession of excess or obsolete inventory, which we may not be able to sell to the customer or a third party. The success of our customers’ products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in sourcing strategy by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results by reducing the number of products that we sell, delaying the payment to us for inventory that we purchased and reducing the use of our manufacturing facilities, which have associated fixed costs not dependent on our level of revenue.. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers’ commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers.. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results.. We structure our agreements with customers to mitigate our risks related to obsolete or unsold inventory. However, enforcement of these contracts may result in material expense and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers become unable or unwilling to purchase such inventory, our business may be materially harmed.. 18. Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.. Our design and manufacturing services offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties, as well as claims arising from the allocation of intellectual property rights between us and our customers. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not they have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.. We have incurred substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may continue to do so in the future.. We have incurred significant expenses related to restructuring of our operations in the past and may continue to do so in the future. We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, costs related to workforce reductions and facility closures. We may be required to record additional charges related to restructuring activities in the future, but cannot predict the timing or amount of such charges. Any such charges would reduce our earnings.. If OEMs stop or reduce their manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing, our business could suffer.. Future growth in our revenues depends on new outsourcing opportunities in which we assume additional manufacturing and supply chain management responsibilities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our capabilities against other providers and the merits of manufacturing products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available, either because OEMs decide to perform these functions internally or because they use other providers of these services, our future growth would be limited.. From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings.. In the past, we have been notified of claims relating to various matters including intellectual property rights, contractual matters or other issues arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to defend or otherwise address the claim. Any litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Accordingly, the resolution or adjudication of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.. We may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate for impairment periodically and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable. During 2017, the Company identified a triggering event related to property, plant and equipment in its U.S. segment asset group and recorded an impairment loss related to the U.S. segment of $1.0 million. In addition, during 2017, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.6 million related predominantly to machinery and equipment in the China segment. These assets were identified as part of the Company’s assessment of its capital requirements and capabilities during the year. Disruptions and reductions to our business, unexpected significant declines in the operating results, divestitures and enterprise value declines may result in future impairment charges to property, plant and equipment. Any future impairment charge could substantially affect our reported results during those periods.. Changes in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, changes in securities laws and regulations could increase our operating costs.. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  A change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions that are completed before a change is announced. Changes to those rules or questions as to how we interpret or implement them may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business. For example, in May 2014 the FASB issued a new standard (ASC 606) which will change the way we recognize revenue and expand the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements. We adopted the requirements of this new standard on January 1, 2018. The Company has determined that the new standard will change the timing of revenue recognition for a significant portion of its business, whereby a significant portion of its revenue will be recognized over a period of time as opposed to a point in time.  This results in recognizing revenue earlier as revenue will be recognized as obligations are performed and costs are incurred.  Under the accounting rules in place until December 31, 2017, the Company recognized revenue when units were shipped. This change in the standard could have a material impact to the Company’s balance sheet, primarily related to a reduction in finished goods and work-in-process inventories and an increase in unbilled contract assets. New controls will be needed to comply with such changes and we may fail to adequately implement the needed changes. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information relating to our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.. We review our internal controls over financial reporting annually. In doing so, we may identify deficiencies in those controls. A material weakness or deficiency in our internal controls could increase the likelihood that a material misstatement or lack of disclosure within the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Adverse publicity related to the disclosure of a material weakness or deficiency in internal controls over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our reputation, business and stock price.. The Company has experienced a significant reduction in revenues in 2016 and 2017, which has negatively impacted our cash flows from operations and liquidity and may continue to impact our cash flows from operations and liquidity during future periods.. The Company has experienced significant reductions in revenue in 2016 and 2017 when compared to prior periods that has impacted cash flows from operations. The Company incurred a net loss in 2016 of $0.2 million and a net loss in 2017 of $7.8 million. Revenues have declined due to the loss of customers that represented a large concentration of the Company’s business. The Company believes this loss of customers is largely due to competitive pressures from larger organizations, which may persist during future periods. This decline in revenues has directly impacted the Company’s gross profit and its ability to generate cash flows from operations. Additional declines in the Company’s revenues during future periods resulting from this challenging business environment may continue to negatively impact the Company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and to satisfy its liquidity needs.. 19. During 2017, the Company included within selling, general and administrative expenses an additional provision for bad debt expenses of $0.7 million that predominately relates to amounts owed by one customer, which management does not believe are collectible. In addition, during 2017, the Company increased the provision for inventory obsolescence by approximately $0.3 million due primarily to an identified collection risk related to aged inventory for a small number of customers. The incurrence by the Company of additional bad debt expense or the need to increase the provision of inventory obsolescence during future periods could negatively impact our cash flows from operations and liquidity.. We depend on our executive officers and skilled management personnel.. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. Generally, our employees are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our executive officers and other key employees. We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees. We will need to recruit and retain skilled management personnel, and if we are not able to do so, our business could be harmed.. RISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.. The Company borrows money under a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”) which governs the PNC Revolving Credit Facility and a Long-Term Debt Facility (“PNC Facilities”). The PNC Facilities have a term ending on January 2, 2021. Advances made under the PNC Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the U.S. base rate plus 0.75%. The applicable interest rate for the Long-Term Debt Facility is U.S. base rate plus 1.25%. The base commercial lending rate should approximate prime rate.. Our debt outstanding under the PNC Facilities could have adverse consequences for our business, including:. • \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe will be more vulnerable to adverse general economic conditions. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe could be limited in our borrowing of additional funds and making strategic investments by restrictive covenants and the borrowing base formula in our credit arrangements. \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t• \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tWe may fail to comply with covenants under our PNC Facilities. The financial covenants require the Company to maintain a minimum EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 2, 2017 and the three months ended October 1, 2017. Subsequent thereafter, the financial covenant relating to a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is in effect for the three months ended December 31, 2017, six months ended April 1, 2018, nine months ended July 1, 2018, twelve months ended September 30, 2018 and thereafter on a rolling twelve month basis until January 2, 2021. The Company is in compliance with the financial covenants included in the PNC Facilities as of December 31, 2017.. Market conditions have been difficult to predict and there is no assurance that the Company will meet these covenants. A failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, it could result in all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, becoming immediately due and payable unless the Company obtains a waiver from the lender.. Our leverage and restrictions contained in the PNC Facilities may materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control.. We face significant restrictions on our ability to operate under the terms of our PNC Facilities.. The terms of our PNC Facilities generally restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, complete acquisitions, make certain investments, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, make capital expenditures, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of our assets (other than in the ordinary course of business). The PNC Facilities also have a borrowing base formula that limits our ability to borrow based on the characteristics, including geographic location of our accounts receivable and inventory. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are pledged as security under our PNC Facilities.. 20. If we are not able to comply with these covenants and requirements, PNC has the right to demand accelerated payment and we would have to seek alternative sources of financing, which may not be available, or be available on acceptable terms. In addition, customers may lose confidence in us and reduce or eliminate their orders with us, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our borrowing base is diminished we may not have sufficient access to capital to finance operations or capital needs.. RISKS RELATED TO TAX LOSS UTILIZATION AND TAX REGULATION. Our ability to recognize tax benefits on our existing U.S. net operating loss position may be limited.. We have generated substantial loss carryforwards and other tax assets for U.S. tax purposes that can be used to reduce our future federal income tax obligations. Our ability to fully use these tax assets will be adversely affected if we have an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by “five-percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382 of the IRC) in a rolling three-year period.. At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company ratified the extension of the SMTC Corporation Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, (the “Plan”) for an additional three year period in order to protect our ability to utilize our net operating losses (“NOLs”) and other tax assets from an “ownership change” under U.S. federal income tax rules. However, there is no guarantee that the Plan will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets.. In the past, the Company has had historical net operating losses expire unutilized. If the Company continues to be unable to generate sufficient taxable income, these losses will continue to expire unutilized and we may not be able to recognize the tax benefits that could arise from such tax losses.. There may be adverse impact resulting from government tax reform on the Company's tax returns and consolidated financial statements.. The Company operates in various foreign jurisdictions and has substantial tax operating loss carryforwards and so expects this tax reform and potential future tax reform could have substantial impact on the Company’s tax filings and consolidated financial statements related to its income tax expense (recovery) and deferred tax assets (liabilities) and corresponding disclosures.. There may be adverse consequences resulting from future governmental tax audits of the Company's tax returns.. The Company has taken various tax positions in determining its tax liabilities and the related expense. It is possible that future tax audits or changes in tax regulation may require the Company to change its prior period tax returns and also to incur additional costs. This may negatively affect future period results.. 21. RISKS RELATED TO SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND LAWS. Changes in the securities laws and regulations have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs and any future changes would likely increase our costs.. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as related rules promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ, required changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and compliance practices. Compliance with these rules has increased our legal and financial accounting costs for several years following the announcement and effectiveness of these new rules. While these costs are no longer increasing, they may in fact increase in the future. In addition, given turmoil in the securities and credit markets in 2008, as well as the global economy, many U.S. and international governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities including, but not limited to, the SEC and NASDAQ, enacted additional changes in their laws, regulations and rules (such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and may be contemplating additional changes. These changes, and any such future changes, may cause our legal and financial accounting costs to increase.. RISKS RELATED TO ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL. We may in the future identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements.. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act.. We cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. The existence of a significant deficiency or material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could in turn result in a restatement of the consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause lenders, suppliers, customers and investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any combination of the above could lead to harmful effects on our business and a decline in our stock price.. 22"
