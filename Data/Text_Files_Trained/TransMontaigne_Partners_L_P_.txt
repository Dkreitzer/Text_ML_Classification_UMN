[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under \"Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" in connection with any investment in our securities. Limited partner interests are inherently different from the capital stock of a corporation, although many of the business risks to which we are subject are similar to those that would be faced by a corporation engaged in a similar business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, we might not be able to continue to make distributions on our common units at current levels, or at all. As a result of any of these risks occurring, the market value of our common units could decline, and investors could lose all or a part of their investment.. Risks Inherent in Our Business. We may not have sufficient cash from operations to enable us to maintain or grow the distribution to our unitholders following establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to our general partner.. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of consumption of products in the markets in which we operate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe prices we obtain for our services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of our operating costs and expenses, including payments to our general partner; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprevailing economic conditions.. Additionally, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders depends on other factors such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of capital expenditures we make;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe restrictions contained in our debt instruments and our debt service requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in our working capital needs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe cost of acquisitions, if any;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe fees and expenses of our general partner and its affiliates that we are required to reimburse; and. 23. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe amount, if any, of reserves, including reserves for future capital expenditures and other matters, established by our general partner in its discretion.. The amount of cash we have available for distribution to our unitholders depends primarily on our cash flow, including cash flow from operations and working capital borrowings, and not solely on earnings, which will be affected by non - cash items. As a result, we may make cash distributions to our unitholders during periods when we incur net losses and may not make cash distributions to our unitholders during periods when we generate net earnings. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, and we may be required to fund our working capital requirements principally with cash generated by our operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As a result, we may not be able to maintain or grow our quarterly distribution to our unitholders.. We depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenue. A substantial reduction of revenue from one or more of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. We expect to derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a small number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.  For example, in 2017 NGL accounted for approximately 26% of our annual revenue. Events that adversely affect the business operations of any one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Therefore, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of our significant customers, many of which are similar to the business risks we face. For example, a material decline in refined petroleum product supplies available to our customers, or a significant decrease in our customers' ability to negotiate marketing contracts on favorable terms, could result in a material decline in the use of our tank capacity or throughput of product at our terminal facilities, which would likely cause our revenue and results of operations to decline. In addition, if any of our significant customers were unable to meet their contractual commitments to us for any reason, then our revenue and cash flow would decline.. We are exposed to the credit risks of our significant customers which could affect our creditworthiness. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by such customers could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We have various credit terms with virtually all of our customers, and our customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness. Although we evaluate the creditworthiness of each of our customers, we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in their creditworthiness and overall financial condition, which could expose us to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our significant customers. Some of our significant customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our significant customers could require us to pursue substitute customers for our affected assets or provide alternative services. There can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or would provide similar revenue. These events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Our continued expansion programs may require access to additional capital. Tightened capital markets or more expensive capital could impair our ability to maintain or grow our operations, or to fund distributions to our unitholders.. Our primary liquidity needs are to fund our approved capital projects and future expansion. Our revolving credit facility provides for a maximum borrowing line of credit equal to $850 million. At December 31, 2017, our outstanding borrowings were $593.2 million. At December 31, 2017, the capital expenditures to complete the approved additional investments and expansion capital projects are estimated to be approximately $70 million. We expect to fund our future investments and expansion capital expenditures with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility. If we cannot obtain adequate financing to complete the approved investments and capital projects while maintaining our current operations, we may not be able to continue to operate our business as it is currently conducted, or we may be unable to maintain or grow the quarterly distribution to our unitholders.. Moreover, our long term business strategies include acquiring additional energy - related terminaling and transportation facilities and further expansion of our existing terminal capacity. We will need to raise additional funds to grow our business and implement these strategies. We anticipate that such additional funds would be raised through equity or debt financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may not be on terms that are favorable to us.. 24. Table of Contents. Limitations on our access to capital, including on our ability to issue additional debt and equity, could result from events or causes beyond our control, and could include, among other factors, significant increases in interest rates, increases in the risk premium required by investors, generally or for investments in energy - related companies or master limited partnerships, decreases in the availability of credit or the tightening of terms required by lenders. An inability to access the capital markets may result in a substantial increase in our leverage and have a detrimental impact on our creditworthiness. If we cannot obtain adequate financing, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategies, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.. Our debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.. As of December 31, 2017, we had total long-term debt of $593.2 million and we had an unused borrowing base availability of $256.8 million under our revolving credit facility. Our level of debt could have important consequences to us. For example our level of debt could:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpair our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for distributions to unitholders, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake us more vulnerable to competitive pressures, changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy generally;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms, or at all.. Restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility, the indenture governing our senior notes and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.. Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes contain, and the terms of any future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur or guarantee additional debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tredeem or repurchase units or make distributions under certain circumstances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake certain investments and acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur certain liens or permit them to exist;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmerge or consolidate with another company; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets.. 25. Table of Contents. Our revolving credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and there is no assurance that that we will meet any such ratios and tests.. The provisions of our revolving credit facility may affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and our unitholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. Please read \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\". We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks that we may face.. Subject to the restrictions in the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness (including our revolving credit facility and senior notes), we may incur substantial additional indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) in the future. Although the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness do contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to waiver and a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. As of December 31, 2017, we had additional borrowing capacity of $256.8 million under our revolving credit facility, all of which would be secured if borrowed.. Any increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe will have additional cash requirements in order to support the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdepending on the levels of our outstanding indebtedness, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general partnership purposes may be limited.. The obligations of our customers under their terminaling services agreements may be reduced or suspended in some circumstances, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Our agreements with our customers provide that, if any of a number of events occur, which we refer to as events of force majeure, and the event renders performance impossible with respect to a facility, usually for a specified minimum period of days, our customer's obligations would be temporarily suspended with respect to that facility. Force majeure events include, but are not limited to, wars, acts of enemies, embargoes, import or export restrictions, strikes, lockouts, acts of nature, including fires, storms, floods, hurricanes, explosions and mechanical or physical failures of our equipment or facilities or those of third parties. In the event of a force majeure, a significant customer's minimum revenue commitment may be reduced or the contract may be subject to termination. As a result, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. A material portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, over which we do not maintain full control and which have unique risks.. A material portion of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. We are entitled to appoint a member to the BOSTCO board of managers and maintain certain rights of approval over significant changes to, or expansion of, BOSTCO's business, however Kinder Morgan serves as the operator of BOSTCO and is responsible for its day-to-day. 26. Table of Contents. operations.   Although we serve as the operator of Frontera, there are restrictions and limitations on our authority to take certain material actions absent the consent of our joint venture partner. With respect to our existing joint ventures, we share ownership with partners that may not always share our goals and objectives. Differences in views among the partners may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major matters, such as large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction of assets or borrowing money, among others. Delay or failure to agree may prevent action with respect to such matters, even though such action may not serve our best interest or that of the joint venture. Accordingly, delayed decisions and disagreements could adversely affect the business and operations of the joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations. From time to time, our joint ventures may be involved in disputes or legal proceedings which may negatively affect our investments. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.. Competition from other terminals and pipelines that are able to supply our customers with storage capacity at a lower price could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. We face competition from other terminals and pipelines that may be able to supply our customers with integrated terminaling services on a more competitive basis. We compete with national, regional and local terminal and pipeline companies, including the major integrated oil companies, of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Our ability to compete could be harmed by factors we cannot control, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprice competition from terminal and transportation companies, some of which are substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources and control substantially greater product storage capacity, than we do;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe perception that another company may provide better service; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of alternative supply points or supply points located closer to our customers' operations.. In addition, our general partner's affiliates, including ArcLight, may engage in competition with us. If we are unable to compete with services offered by our competitors, including ArcLight and its affiliates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Many of our terminal facilities are connected to, and rely on, pipelines owned and operated by third parties for the receipt and distribution of refined petroleum products, and such pipeline operators may compete with us, make changes to their transportation service offerings or their pipeline tariffs, or suffer outages or reduced product transportation, which in each case would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Our Southeast facilities include 22 refined product terminals located along the Plantation and Colonial pipeline systems and primarily receive products from Plantation and Colonial on behalf of our customers. In addition, the Collins/Purvis bulk storage terminal receives from, delivers to, and transfers refined petroleum products between the Colonial and Plantation pipeline systems. In these instances, we depend on our terminals' connections to such petroleum pipelines owned and operated by third parties to supply our terminal facilities. Our ability to compete in a particular terminal market could be harmed by factors we cannot control, including changes in pipeline service offerings at one or more of our terminals or changes in pipeline tariffs that make alternative third party terminal locations or different transportation options more attractive to our current or prospective customers.. The FERC regulates the rates the pipeline operators can charge, and the terms and conditions they can offer, for interstate transportation service on refined products pipelines that connect to our terminals.  Generally, petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed levels, which could lead our current or prospective customers to seek alternative delivery methods or destinations. Moreover, we cannot control or predict the amount of refined petroleum products that our customers are able to transport on the third party pipelines connecting into our terminals. The level of throughput on these pipelines can be impacted by a number of factors, including the quality or quantity of refined product produced, pipeline outages or interruptions due to weather-related or other natural causes, competitive forces, testing, line repair, damage, reduced operating pressures or other causes any of which could. 27. Table of Contents. negatively impact our customers' shipments to our terminals. As a result, our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. If we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, the future growth of our business will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash available for distribution on a per unit basis.. Our ability to grow has been dependent principally on our ability to make acquisitions that are attractive because they are expected to result in an increase in our quarterly distributions to unitholders. Our ability to acquire facilities will be based, in part, on divestitures of product terminal and transportation facilities by large industry participants. A material decrease in such divestitures could therefore limit our opportunities for future acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in the cash available for distribution on a per unit basis.. In addition, we may be unable to make attractive acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be outbid by competitors, some of which are substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with the seller;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to obtain financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may be unable to obtain necessary governmental or third-party consents.. If we consummate future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our capital resources.. Any acquisitions we make are subject to substantial risks, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Any acquisition involves potential risks, including risks that we may:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfail to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost - savings or cash flow enhancements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecrease our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsignificantly increase our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tencounter difficulties operating in new geographic areas or new lines of business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe unable to secure adequate customer commitments to use the acquired systems or facilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur or assume unanticipated liabilities, losses or costs associated with the business or assets acquired for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity is inadequate;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe unable to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets;. 28. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbe unable to successfully integrate the assets or businesses we acquire;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tless effectively manage our historical assets because of the diversion of management's attention; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.. If any acquisitions we ultimately consummate result in one or more of these outcomes, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.. Expanding our business by constructing new facilities subjects us to risks that the project may not be completed on schedule and that the costs associated with the project may exceed our estimates or budgeted costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing terminal and transportation facilities, and the construction of new terminals and pipelines, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, legal and operational uncertainties beyond our control and requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at all and may exceed the budgeted cost. If we experience material cost overruns, we would have to finance these overruns using cash from operations, delaying other planned projects, incurring additional indebtedness or issuing additional equity. Any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we construct additional storage capacity, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and we will not receive any material increases in revenue until the project is completed. Moreover, we may construct additional storage capacity to capture anticipated future growth in consumption of products in a market in which such growth does not materialize.. Adverse economic conditions periodically result in weakness and volatility in the capital markets, that may limit, temporarily or for extended periods, the ability of one or more of our significant customers to secure financing arrangements adequate to purchase their desired volume of product, which could reduce use of our tank capacity and throughput volumes at our terminal facilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Domestic and international economic conditions affect the functioning of capital markets and the availability of credit. Adverse economic conditions, such as those prevalent during the recent recessionary period, periodically result in weakness and volatility in the capital markets, which in turn can limit, temporarily or for extended periods, the credit available to various enterprises, including those involved in the supply and marketing of refined products. As a result of these conditions, some of our customers may suffer short or long - term reductions in their ability to finance their supply and marketing activities, or may voluntarily elect to reduce their supply and marketing activities in order to preserve working capital. A significant decrease in our customers' ability to secure financing arrangements adequate to support their historic refined product throughput volumes could result in a material decline in the use of our tank capacity or the throughput of refined product at our terminal facilities. We may not be able to generate sufficient additional revenue from third parties to replace any shortfall in revenue from our current customers, which would likely cause our revenue and results of operations to decline and may impair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders.. Our business involves many hazards and operational risks, including adverse weather conditions, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and increased operating costs.. Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the terminaling and transportation of products, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tleaks or accidental releases of products or other materials into the environment, whether as a result of human error or otherwise;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\textreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tropical storms and rough seas, which are common along the Gulf Coast, and earthquakes, which are common along the West Coast;. 29. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texplosions, fires, accidents, mechanical malfunctions, faulty measurement and other operating errors; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacts of terrorism or vandalism.. If any of these events were to occur, we could suffer substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of storage tanks, pipelines and related property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our related operations and potentially substantial unanticipated costs for the repair or replacement of property and environmental cleanup. In addition, if we suffer accidental releases or spills of products at our terminals or pipelines, we could be faced with material third - party costs and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons and governmental claims for natural resource damages or fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We are not fully insured against all risks to our business and if losses in excess of our insurance coverage were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Furthermore, events like hurricanes can affect large geographical areas which can cause us to suffer additional costs and delays in connection with subsequent repairs and operations because contractors and other resources are not available, or are only available at substantially increased costs following widespread catastrophes.. We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business, and could incur substantial liabilities as a result.. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates.  As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially, and could escalate further. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.  For example, our insurance carriers require broad exclusions for losses due to terrorist acts.  If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In accordance with typical industry practice, we do not have any property or title insurance on the Razorback and Diamondback pipelines.. Our insurance policies each contain caps on the insurer's maximum liability under the policy, and claims made by us are applied against the caps.  In the event we reach the cap, we would seek to acquire additional insurance in the marketplace; however, we can provide no assurance that such insurance would be available or if available, at a reasonable cost.. A significant decrease in demand for refined products due to alternative fuel sources, new technologies or adverse economic conditions may cause one or more of our significant customers to reduce their use of our tank capacity and throughput volumes at our terminal facilities, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Market uncertainties, adverse economic conditions or lack of consumer confidence resulting in lower consumer spending on gasolines, distillates and travel, and high prices of refined products may cause a reduction in demand for refined products, which could result in a material decline in the use of our tank capacity or throughput of product at our terminal facilities. Additionally, the volatility in the price of refined products may render our customers' hedging activities ineffective, which could cause one or more of our significant customers to decrease their supply and marketing activities in order to reduce their exposure to price fluctuations.. Additional factors that could lead to a decrease in market demand for refined products include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan increase in the market price of crude oil that leads to higher refined product prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigher fuel taxes or other governmental or other regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of gasolines or other refined products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta shift by consumers to more fuel - efficient or alternative fuel vehicles or an increase in fuel economy,. 30. Table of Contents. whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, pending legislation proposing to mandate higher fuel economy or otherwise; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tan increase in the use of alternative fuel sources, such as ethanol, biodiesel, fuel cells and solar, electric and battery - powered engines.. Mergers between our existing customers and our competitors could provide strong economic incentives for the combined entities to utilize their existing systems instead of ours in those markets where the systems compete. As a result, we could lose some or all of the volumes and associated revenues from these customers and we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes and revenues.. Because most of our operating costs are fixed, any decrease in throughput volumes at our terminal facilities, would likely result not only in a decrease in our revenue, but also a decline in cash flow of a similar magnitude, which would adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and may impair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders.. Cyber-attacks that circumvent our security measures and other breaches of our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and result in increased costs.. We utilize information technology systems to operate our assets and manage our businesses. A cyber-attack or other security breach of our information technology systems could result in a breach of critical operational or financial controls and lead to a disruption of our operations, commercial activities or financial processes. Additionally, we rely on third - party systems that could also be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches, and the failure of which could have a significant adverse effect on the operation of our assets. We and the operators of the third - party systems on which we depend may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent every emerging type of cyber-attack, and such an attack, or the additional security measures undertaken to prevent such an attack, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.. In addition, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and information about our customers, suppliers and other counterparties, and personally identifiable information of the employees of TLP Management Services, on our information technology networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disseminated, lost or stolen. Any such access, dissemination or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties or could disrupt our operations, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.. Because of our lack of asset diversification, adverse developments in our terminals or pipeline operations could adversely affect our revenue and cash flows.. We rely exclusively on the revenue generated from our terminals and pipeline operations. Because of our lack of diversification in asset type, an adverse development in these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets.. Our operations are subject to governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.. Our business is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous governmental agencies that enforce complex and stringent laws and regulations with respect to a wide range of environmental, safety and other regulatory matters. We could be adversely affected by increased costs resulting from more strict pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non - compliance with required operating or other regulatory permits. New environmental laws and regulations might adversely impact our activities, including the transportation, storage and distribution of petroleum products. Federal, state and local agencies also could impose additional safety requirements, any of which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, our failure to comply with environmental or safety related laws and regulations also could. 31. Table of Contents. result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and even the issuance of injunctions that restrict or prohibit the performance of our operations.. Federal, state and local agencies also have the authority to prescribe specific product quality specifications of refined products. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volume, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets impact the fungibility of the products in our system and could require the construction of additional storage. If we are unable to recover these costs through increased revenues, our cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions could be adversely affected.. Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.. The long - term impact of terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, and the threat of future terrorist attacks, on the energy transportation industry in general, and on us in particular, is impossible to predict. Increased security measures that we have taken as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the Middle East or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terrorism.. Many of our storage tanks and portions of our pipeline system have been in service for several decades that could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to pay cash distributions.. Our pipeline and storage assets are generally long - lived assets. As a result, some of those assets have been in service for many decades. The age and condition of these assets could result in increased maintenance or remediation expenditures. Any significant increase in these expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions.. In the event we are required to refinance our existing debt in unfavorable market conditions, we may have to pay higher interest rates and be subject to more stringent financial covenants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and may impair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders.. Our revolving credit facility matures in March 2022, and our senior notes mature in February 2026. At December 31, 2017 and February 12, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $593.2 million and outstanding senior notes of $300 million outstanding, respectively. Our revolving credit facility provides that we pay interest on outstanding balances at interest rates based on market rates plus specified margins, ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% depending on the total leverage ratio in the case of loans with interest rates based on LIBOR, or ranging from 0.75% to 1.75% depending on the total leverage ratio in the case of loans with interest rates based on the base rate. We pay a fixed 6.125% interest rate on our senior notes. In the event we are required to refinance our revolving credit facility or our senior notes in unfavorable market conditions, we may have to pay interest at higher rates and may be subject to more stringent financial covenants than we have today, which could adversely affect our results of operations and may impair our ability to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders.. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \"greenhouse gases\" or setting fuel economy or air quality standards could result in increased operating costs or reduced demand for the refined petroleum products that we transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our business.. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish pre-construction and operating permit requirements for certain large stationary sources.  The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore natural gas and oil sources in. 32. Table of Contents. the United States on an annual basis.. Although Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years.  In the absence of such federal climate change legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs.  Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved.. In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the \"Paris Agreement\").  The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 170 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement.  However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or a separate agreement.  In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States' intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States' adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.  To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.. In particular, the adoption and implementation of regulations that require the reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for the refined petroleum products, natural gas and other hydrocarbon products we transport, store or otherwise handle in connection with our business by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on the combustion of fossil fuels. Such decreased demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. In addition, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events.  If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.. Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us. ArcLight indirectly controls our general partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. ArcLight has conflicts of interest with and limited fiduciary duties to us, which may permit them to favor their own interests to our detriment.. TransMontaigne GP is our general partner and manages our operations and activities. ArcLight owns our general partner and is responsible under our omnibus agreement for providing the personnel who provide support to our operations. Neither our general partner nor its board of directors is elected by our unitholders, and our unitholders have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis. Furthermore, it may be difficult for unitholders to remove our general partner without its consent because the vote of the holders of at least 662/3% of all outstanding common units, including any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates, but excluding the general partner interest, voting together as a single class, is required to remove our general partner.. Additionally, any or all of the provisions of our omnibus agreement with ArcLight other than the indemnification provisions, will be terminable by ArcLight at its option if our general partner is removed without cause and common units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal. Cause is narrowly defined in the omnibus agreement to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non - appealable. 33. Table of Contents. judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business.. Four of our general partner's directors are affiliated with ArcLight. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between ArcLight and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and our general partner, on the one hand, and us and our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving those conflicts of interest, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders.. These conflicts include, among others, the following potential conflicts of interest:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tArcLight and its affiliates may engage in competition with us under certain circumstances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tExcept in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tNeither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires ArcLight or its affiliates to pursue a business strategy that favors us. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or any limited partner. ArcLight's directors and officers have fiduciary duties to make decisions in the best interests of ArcLight, which may be contrary to our interests or the interests of our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as ArcLight, or its affiliates, in resolving conflicts of interest.  Specifically, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is \"fair and reasonable,\" our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCertain directors of our general partner are officers or directors of affiliates of our general partner, including ArcLight, and also devote significant time to the business of these entities and are compensated accordingly;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner has limited its liability and reduced its fiduciary duties, and also has restricted the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Our general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed that its decision was in the best interests of our partnership;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner determines the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions, capital expenditures, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities, and reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner determines the amount and timing of any capital expenditures by our partnership and whether a capital expenditure is a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. That determination can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur partnership agreement permits us to treat a distribution of a certain amount of cash from non - operating sources such as asset sales, issuances of securities and long - term borrowings as a distribution of operating surplus instead of capital surplus. The amount that can be distributed in such a  fashion is equal to four times the amount needed for us to pay a quarterly distribution on the common units, the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights at the same per - unit distribution amount as the distribution paid. 34. Table of Contents. in the immediately preceding quarter. As of December 31, 2017, that amount was $62.3 million, $23.0 million of which would go to our general partner in the form of distributions on their general partner interest and incentive distribution rights;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner determines which out - of - pocket costs incurred by TLP Management Services are reimbursable by us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us, our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non - appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tOur general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services on our behalf.. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the omnibus agreement, we may incur additional costs to replicate the services currently provided thereunder, in which event our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Our partnership has no officers or employees and all of our management and operational activities are provided by officers and employees of TLP Management Services, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of ArcLight. Under the omnibus agreement we pay TLP Management Services an annual administrative fee for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit.. The omnibus agreement expires on the earlier to occur of ArcLight ceasing to control our general partner or following at least 24 months' prior written notice to the other parties. We cannot predict whether a change of control will occur, or whether our general partner will seek to terminate, amend or modify the terms of the omnibus agreement.  Following the expiration or the earlier termination of the omnibus agreement, the partnership will be required to assume directly or indirectly through one or more service providers, the scope of the services provided to the partnership under the omnibus agreement.  If we are unsuccessful in negotiating acceptable terms with a successor service provider, if we are required to pay a higher administrative fee or if we must incur substantial costs to replicate the services currently provided by ArcLight and its affiliates under the omnibus agreement, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.. Affiliates of our general partner, including ArcLight, may compete with us and do not have any obligation to present business opportunities to us.. Neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement will prohibit affiliates of our general partner, including ArcLight, from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. For example, an affiliate of ArcLight is the majority owner of the general partner of another publicly traded master limited partnership in the midstream segment of the energy industry, which may compete with us in the future. In addition, ArcLight and other affiliates of our general partner may acquire, construct or dispose of midstream assets or other assets in the future without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. ArcLight and its affiliates are large, established participants in the energy industry and may have greater resources than we have, which may make it more difficult for us to compete with these entities with respect to commercial activities as well as for acquisition opportunities. As a result, competition from affiliates of our general partner, including ArcLight, could materially adversely impact our results of operations and distributable cash flow.. The control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without the consent of our general partner, the partnership or our unitholders.. Our general partner may transfer its general partner interest in TransMontaigne Partners to a third party in a merger, a sale of all or substantially all of the general partner's assets or other transaction without the consent of the general partner on behalf of the partnership. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of ArcLight, the owner of our general partner, from transferring its limited liability company interest in our general partner. 35. Table of Contents. to a third party. The new owner of our general partner could then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with their own choices and to control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers.  In that event, our general partner would be able to take steps to protect the interests of the partnership.. Fees due to our general partner and its affiliates for services provided under the omnibus agreement are and will continue to be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders.. Payments to our general partner are and will continue to be substantial and will reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to unitholders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid affiliates of our general partner an administrative fee of approximately $12.8 million pursuant to the omnibus agreement.  The administrative fee is subject to increase at the request of ArcLight in the event we acquire or construct facilities. Our general partner and its affiliates will continue to be entitled to reimbursement for all other direct expenses they incur on our behalf, including the salaries of and the cost of employee benefits for employees working on - site at our terminals and pipelines. Our general partner will determine the amount of these expenses.  Our general partner and its affiliates also may provide us other services for which we will be charged fees as determined by our general partner.. Our general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.. If at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then - current market price. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their common units.. We may issue additional units without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.. Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects: your proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease; the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and the market price of the common units may decline.. The market price of our common units may be adversely affected by the future issuance and sale of additional common units or by our announcement that such issuances and sales may occur.. We have an effective universal shelf - registration statement on Form S - 3 and an existing sales agreement filed with the SEC in our Prospectus Supplement to Prospectus dated September 2, 2016, which sales agreement covers \"at-the-market\" equity issuances that may be made from time to time through our sales agent.  We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common units, including, pursuant to our outstanding sales agreement, or in connection with future acquisitions or capital raising activities, or the effect, if any, that such issuances or sales may have on the market price of our common units.  In addition, under the sales agreement, the sales agent will not engage in any transactions that stabilize the price of our common units.  The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common units, including issuances and sales pursuant to the sales agreement, or announcement that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common units.. Unitholders may not have limited liability in some circumstances.. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partnership interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some states. If it were determined that we had been conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute, or that our unitholders as a group took any action pursuant to our partnership agreement that constituted participation in the \"control\" of our business, then the unitholders could be held liable under some circumstances for our obligations to the same extent as a general partner.. 36. Table of Contents. Under applicable state law, our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations, including our debts and environmental liabilities, if any, except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner.. In addition, Section 17 - 607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act provides that under some circumstances a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of distributions paid to the unitholder for a period of three years from the date of the distribution.. Tax Risks. Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as not being subject to a material amount of entity - level taxation by states. If the Internal Revenue Service were to treat us as a corporation or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity - level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced.. The anticipated after - tax benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on us being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this matter.. A publicly - traded partnership may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless its gross income from its business activities satisfies a \"qualifying income\" requirement under the U.S. tax code. Based upon our current operations, we believe that we qualify to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes under these requirements. While we intend to continue to meet this gross income requirement, we may not find it possible to meet, or may inadvertently fail to meet, these requirements. If we do not meet these requirements for any taxable year, and the IRS does not determine that such failure was inadvertent, we would be treated as a corporation for such taxable year and each taxable year thereafter.. If we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21%. In such a circumstance, distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions (if such distributions were less than our earnings and profits) and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to our unitholders. Imposition of a corporate tax would substantially reduce our cash flows and after - tax return to our unitholders. This likely would cause a substantial reduction in the value of the common units.. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the qualifying income requirements, affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in a publicly traded partnership, including us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our common units. We are unable to predict whether any current or future proposed federal income tax law changes will ultimately be enacted.. In addition, some states have subjected partnerships to entity - level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation, and other states may follow this trend. If any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity, our cash flows would be reduced. For example, under current legislation, we are subject to an entity - level tax on the portion of our total revenue (as that term is defined in the legislation) that is generated in Texas. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a liability of approximately $0.1 million for the Texas margin tax, which is imposed at a maximum effective rate of 0.75% of our total revenue and tax gains from Texas. Imposition of such a tax on us by Texas, or any other state, will reduce the cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity - level taxation for federal, state or local income tax purposes, then the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be reduced to reflect the impact of that law on us.. 37. Table of Contents. If the sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profit interests occurs within a 12 - month period, we would experience a deemed technical termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes.. The sale or exchange of 50% or more of the partnership's units within a 12 - month period would result in a deemed technical termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes. Such an event would not terminate a unitholder's interest in the partnership, nor would it terminate the continuing business operations of the partnership. However, it would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and would result in a deferral of depreciation and cost recovery deductions allowable in computing our taxable income for future tax years.. The partnership has previously experienced three deemed technical terminations.  The first deemed technical termination experienced by the partnership was for the period ended December 30, 2007, due to a change in our ownership structure effective December 31, 2007.  The second deemed technical termination experienced by the partnership was for the period ended December 30, 2014, due to post transaction restructuring of NGL's investment in TransMontaigne LLC, including the conversion of TransMontaigne LLC, TransMontaigne Services LLC and TransMontaigne Product Services LLC from Delaware corporations into Delaware limited liability companies effective December 30, 2014. Further, as a result of TransMontaigne Partners' technical termination, Frontera also experienced a technical termination on December 30, 2014.  Unrelated to TransMontaigne Partners and Frontera's technical terminations, BOSTCO experienced a technical termination as of November 26, 2014, caused by the restructuring of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and its affiliates.. Pursuant to the Arclight acquisition, on April 1, 2016, affiliates of ArcLight acquired approximately 3.2 million of our common limited partnership units from NGL.  As a result of this transaction, combined with the Arclight acquisition on February 1, 2016 and the other exchanges of our common units within the 12-month prior period, the partnership experienced a third technical termination as of April 1, 2016.  Further, as a result of TransMontaigne Partners' technical termination, Frontera also experienced a technical termination on April 1, 2016.  Due to these technical terminations experienced for federal income tax purposes, our partnership and the Frontera joint venture will realize a deferral of cost recovery deductions that will impact each of our unitholders through allocations of an increased amount of federal taxable income (or reduced amount of allocated loss) for the current and subsequent years.. If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments to increase our capital asset base, we may encounter future declines in our tax depreciation, which may cause some unitholders to recognize higher taxable income in respect of their units and adversely affect the tax characteristics of an investment in our units and reduce the market price of our units.. Prior to July 1, 2014, Morgan Stanley indirectly controlled our general partner and was a bank holding company under applicable federal banking law and regulation, which imposed limitations on Morgan Stanley and its affiliates' ability to conduct certain nonbanking activities. As a result of such regulation, Morgan Stanley informed us in October 2011 that it was unable, or limited in approving any \"significant\" acquisition or investment. The practical effect of these limitations significantly constrained our ability to expand our asset base and operations through acquisitions from third parties, limiting additions to our capital assets primarily to additions and improvements that we constructed or added to our existing facilities. Although we are no longer under such regulatory constraints, if we do not grow our capital asset base quickly enough to avoid our tax depreciation from declining in the future, some unitholders may recognize higher taxable income. The federal and state tax laws and regulations applicable to an investment in our units are complex and each investor's tax considerations are likely to be different from those of other investors, so it is impossible to state with certainty the impact of any change on any single investor or group of investors in our units. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to investigate the legal and tax consequences, under the laws of pertinent jurisdictions, of an investment in our common units. Accordingly, each unitholder or prospective investor in our units is urged to consult with, and depend upon, their tax counsel or other advisor with regard to those matters.. Nevertheless, adverse changes in investors' perception of the tax characteristics of an investment in our units could adversely affect the market value of our units.. 38. Table of Contents. We generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. For administrative purposes and consistent with other publicly traded partnerships, we generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss, and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury regulations. If the IRS were to challenge this method, or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.. Unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their respective share of our taxable income regardless of the amount of cash distributions.. Unitholders will be required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on the unitholder's respective share of our taxable income, whether or not such unitholder receives cash distributions from us. In addition, supplemental taxes that apply to net investment income from passive activities and from gains on sales of partnership interests may be required of unitholders. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to the unitholder's respective share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from the unitholder's respective share of our taxable income or due to the unitholder's taxes relating to net investment income.. Tax - exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.. Investment in common partnership units by tax - exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts, and non - United States persons raises tax issues unique to them. For example, the partnership's ordinary income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax, including individual retirement accounts and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, and may be taxable to them. Due to allocations of reportable tax items to unitholders being dependent on the date of each unitholder's purchase of our common units, we are not able to provide an estimate of a unitholder's UBTI prior to processing that unitholder's Schedule K - 1. Because the partnership's distributions are attributed to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business, distributions to non - United States persons are subject to withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate set by the federal tax laws in effect at the time of such distributions. Nominees, rather than the partnership, are treated as withholding agents. Non - United States persons will be required to file United States federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.. We may be required to deduct and withhold amounts from distributions to foreign unitholders related to withholding tax obligations arising from the sale or disposition of our units by foreign unitholders.. Upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of a unit by a foreign unitholder, the transferee is generally required to withhold 10% of the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition if any portion of the gain on such sale, exchange or other disposition would be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. If the transferee fails to satisfy this withholding requirement, we will be required to deduct and withhold such amount (plus interest) from future distributions to the transferee. Because the \"amount realized\" would include a unitholder's share of our nonrecourse liabilities, 10% of the amount realized could exceed the total cash purchase price for such disposed units. Due to this fact, our inability to match transferors and transferees of units, and other uncertainty surrounding the application of these withholding rules, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS have currently suspended these rules for transfers of certain publicly traded partnership interests, including transfers of our units, until regulations or other guidance has been issued. It is unclear when such regulations or other guidance will be issued.. 39. Table of Contents. Our unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.. In addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local income taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file returns and pay state and local income tax in some or all of these jurisdictions, and unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. It is our unitholders' responsibility to file all United States federal, state and local tax returns.. We will treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our units.. Because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units, we adopt various conventions for administrative purposes (including depreciation and amortization positions) that may not conform in all aspects to existing Treasury regulations. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from any sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder's tax returns.. A unitholder whose units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.. Because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from loaning their units."
