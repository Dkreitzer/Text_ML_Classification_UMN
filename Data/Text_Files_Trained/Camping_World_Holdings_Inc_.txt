[1] "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. RISK FACTORS. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. In these circumstances, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Business. Our business is affected by the availability of financing to us and our customers.. Our business is affected by the availability of financing to us and our customers. Generally, RV dealers, including us, finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. As of December 31, 2017, we had up to $1.415 billion in maximum borrowing capacity under the Floor Plan Facility of which $974.0 million was outstanding and, after deducting $77.1 million for approved purchases that were in process at the manufacturers and $31.3 million of borrowings included in accounts payable for sold inventory, the available line for future inventory purchases as of December 31, 2017 was $226.4 million. The Floor Plan Facility also provides a $35.0 million revolving line of credit. No borrowings were outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 89.0% of the invoice cost of new RV inventory and no used RV inventory was financed under the Floor Plan Facility. A decrease in the availability of this type of wholesale financing or an increase in the cost of such wholesale financing could prevent us from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which may limit product offerings and could lead to reduced sales and revenues.. Furthermore, many of our customers finance their RV purchases. Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for RVs, and may continue to do so. There continue to be fewer lenders, more stringent underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements than in the past. If credit conditions or the credit worthiness of our customers worsen, and adversely affect the ability of consumers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in the sales of our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Fuel shortages, or high prices for fuel, could have a negative effect on our business.. Gasoline or diesel fuel is required for the operation of RVs. There can be no assurance that the supply of these petroleum products will continue uninterrupted, that rationing will not be imposed or that the price of or tax on these petroleum products will not significantly increase in the future. Shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a material adverse effect on the RV industry as a whole in the past and any such shortages or substantial increases in the price of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. 29. Table of Contents. Our success depends to a significant extent on the well - being, as well as the continued popularity and reputation for quality, of our manufacturers, particularly Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc.. Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc. supplied approximately 77.8%, 11.9%, and 6.7%, respectively, of our new RV inventory as of December 31, 2017. We depend on our manufacturers to provide us with products that compare favorably with competing products in terms of quality, performance, safety and advanced features. Any adverse change in the production efficiency, product development efforts, technological advancement, marketplace acceptance, reputation, marketing capabilities or financial condition of our manufacturers, particularly Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc., could have a substantial adverse impact on our business. Any difficulties encountered by any of our manufacturers, particularly Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc., resulting from economic, financial, or other factors could adversely affect the quality and amount of products that they are able to supply to us and the services and support they provide to us.. The interruption or discontinuance of the operations of Thor Industries, Inc., Forest River, Inc., and Winnebago Industries, Inc. or other manufacturers could cause us to experience shortfalls, disruptions, or delays with respect to needed inventory. Although we believe that adequate alternate sources would be available that could replace any manufacturer as a product source, those alternate sources may not be available at the time of any interruption, and alternative products may not be available at comparable quality and prices.. Our supply arrangements with manufacturers are typically governed by dealer agreements, which are customary in the RV industry. Our dealer agreements with manufacturers are generally made on a location - by - location basis, and each retail location typically enters into multiple dealer agreements with multiple manufacturers. Our dealer agreements also generally provide for a one - year term, which is typically renewed annually. The terms of our dealer agreements are typically subject to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tus meeting all the requirements and conditions of the manufacturer's applicable programs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tus maintaining certain minimum inventory requirements and meeting certain retail sales objectives;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tus performing services and repairs for all owners of the manufacturer's RVs (regardless from whom the RV was purchased) that are still under warranty and us carrying the manufacturer's parts and accessories needed to service and repair the manufacturer's RVs in stock at all times;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tus actively advertising and promoting the manufacturer's RVs; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tus indemnifying the manufacturer under certain circumstances.. Our dealer agreements generally designate a specific geographical territory for us, which is often exclusive to us, provided that we are able to meet the material obligations of the applicable dealer agreement.. In addition, many of our dealer agreements contain stocking level requirements and certain of our dealer agreements contain contractual provisions concerning minimum advertised product pricing for current model year units. Wholesale pricing is generally established on a model year basis and is subject to change in the manufacturer's sole discretion. In certain cases, the manufacturer may also establish a suggested retail price, below which we cannot advertise that manufacturer's RVs. Any change, non - renewal, unfavorable renegotiation or termination of these arrangements for any reason could adversely affect product availability and cost and our financial performance.. 30. Table of Contents. Our business model is impacted by general economic conditions in our markets, and ongoing economic and financial uncertainties may cause a decline in consumer spending that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. As a business that relies on consumer discretionary spending, we may be adversely affected if our customers reduce, delay or forego their purchases of our services, protection plans, products and resources as a result of:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tjob losses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tbankruptcies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigher consumer debt and interest rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treduced access to credit;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thigher energy and fuel costs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trelative or perceived cost, availability and comfort of RV use versus other modes of travel, such as air travel and rail;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfalling home prices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlower consumer confidence;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty or changes in tax policies and tax rates; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tuncertainty due to national or international security concerns.. We also rely on our retail locations to attract and retain customers and to build our customer database. If we close retail locations or are unable to open or acquire new retail locations due to general economic conditions or otherwise, our ability to maintain and grow our customer database and our Active Customers will be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.. Decreases in Active Customers, average spend per customer or retention and renewal rates for our consumer services and plans would negatively affect our financial performance, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. Promotional activities and decreased demand for consumer products could also affect our profitability and margins. In addition, adverse economic conditions may result in an increase in our operating expenses due to, among other things, higher costs of labor, energy, equipment and facilities. Due to recent fluctuations in the U.S. economy, our sales, operating and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict, making it difficult to forecast results for future periods. Additionally, we are subject to economic fluctuations in local markets that may not reflect the economic conditions of the U.S. economy. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, the success of our recurring Good Sam consumer services and plans depends, in part, on our customers' use of certain RV sites and/or the purchase of services, protection plans, products and resources through participating merchants. If general economic conditions worsen, our customers may perceive that they have less disposable income for leisure activities or they may not be able to obtain credit for discretionary purchases. As a result, they may travel less frequently, spend less when they travel and purchase and utilize our services, protection plans, products and resources less often, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if we face increased competition from other businesses with similar product and service offerings, we may need to respond by establishing pricing, marketing and other programs or by seeking out additional strategic alliances or acquisitions that may be less favorable to us than we could otherwise establish or obtain in more. 31. Table of Contents. favorable economic environments. In addition, declines in the national economy could cause merchants who participate in our programs to go out of business. It is likely that, should the number of merchants entering bankruptcy rise, the number of uncollectible accounts would also rise. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We depend on our ability to attract and retain customers.. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain Active Customers for our services, protection plans, products and resources. The extent to which we achieve growth in our customer base and sustain high renewal rates of our recurring consumer services and plans materially influences our profitability. Any number of factors could affect our ability to grow our customer base and sustain high renewal rates of our recurring consumer services and plans. These factors include consumer preferences, the frequency with which customers utilize our services, protection plans, products and resources, general economic conditions, our ability to maintain our retail locations, weather conditions, the availability of alternative services, protection plans, products and resources, significant increases in gasoline prices, the disposable income of consumers available for discretionary expenditures and the external perception of our brands. Any significant decline in our customer base, the growth of our customer base or the usage of our services, protection plans, products or resources by our customers, including the renewal rates of our recurring consumer services and plans, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Competition in the market for services, protection plans, products and resources targeting the RV lifestyle or RV enthusiast could reduce our revenues and profitability.. The markets for services, protection plans, products and resources targeting RV, outdoor and active sports enthusiasts are highly fragmented and competitive. Major competitive factors that drive the RV, outdoor and active sports markets are price, product and service features, technology, performance, reliability, quality, availability, variety, delivery and customer service. We compete directly or indirectly with the following types of companies:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmajor national insurance and warranty companies, providers of roadside assistance and providers of extended service contracts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother dealers of new and used RVs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tindependent, local specialty stores, such as \"mom & pops\";.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother large-format outdoor and active sports goods stores and chains, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors, REI, Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela's) and Sportsman's Warehouse;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmulti-channel retailers and mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and online retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Wal-Mart;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through retail, catalog or e - commerce businesses, such as Bass Pro Shops (including Cabela's), Sportsman's Warehouse and REI; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tonline retailers.. Additional competitors may enter the businesses in which we currently operate. Moreover, some of our mass merchandising competitors do not currently compete in many of the product categories we offer, but may choose to offer a broader array of competing products in the future. Particularly in the larger outdoor goods and services market outside the RV market, our competitors may have a larger number of stores and greater market presence, name recognition and financial, distribution and marketing resources than us. Moreover, some of our competitors may build new stores in or near our existing locations. In addition, an increase in the number of aggregator and price comparison sites for insurance products may negatively. 32. Table of Contents. impact our sales of these products. If any of our competitors successfully provides a broader, more efficient or attractive combination of services, protection plans, products and resources to our target customers, our business results could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our expansion into new, unfamiliar markets, businesses, products lines or categories presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new markets, businesses, product lines or categories. Delays in opening or acquiring new retail locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We intend to continue to expand by building or acquiring new retail locations in new markets and may elect to acquire new business, product lines or categories. As a result, we may have less familiarity with local consumer preferences and less business, product or category knowledge with respect to new businesses, product lines or categories, and could encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of consumer familiarity with our brands or reduced product or category knowledge. Other factors that may impact our ability to open or acquire new retail locations in new markets and to operate them profitably or acquire new businesses, product lines or categories, many of which are beyond our control, include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or new locations, including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to determine consumer demand for our products in the locations we select;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to secure product lines;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of construction materials and labor for new retail locations and significant construction delays or cost overruns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to accurately assess the profitability of potential acquisitions or new locations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel, especially management personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the geographic areas where new retail locations are built or acquired;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to supply new retail locations with inventory in a timely manner;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour competitors building or leasing retail locations near our retail locations or in locations we have identified as targets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tregional economic and other factors in the geographic areas in which we expand; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending and the overall strength of our business.. Once we decide on a new market and identify a suitable location or acquisition opportunity, any delays in opening or acquiring new retail locations could impact our financial results. It is possible that events, such as delays in the entitlements process or construction delays caused by permitting or licensing issues, material shortages, labor issues, weather delays or other acts of god, discovery of contaminants, accidents, deaths or injuries, could delay planned openings beyond their expected dates or force us to abandon planned openings altogether.. 33. Table of Contents. As we grow, we will face the risk that our existing resources and systems, including management resources, accounting and finance personnel and operating systems, may be inadequate to support our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain the personnel or make the changes in our systems that may be required to support our growth. Failure to secure these resources and implement these systems on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, hiring additional personnel and implementing changes and enhancements to our systems will require capital expenditures and other increased costs that could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.. Our expansion into new markets, businesses, products or categories may also create new distribution and merchandising challenges, including additional strain on our distribution centers, an increase in information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from existing operations. To the extent that we are not able to meet these additional challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating expenses could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Finally, the size, timing, and integration of any future new retail location openings or acquisitions or the acquisition of new businesses, product lines or categories may cause substantial fluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter. In particular, with respect to the additional 72 Gander Outdoors locations we plan to open by May 2018, given our lack of operating history of the store locations, we expect to be exposed to longer start up times to reach profitability than our traditional greenfield location openings. We anticipate that these new store locations will negatively impact our retail segment margins during this ramp up period. Consequently, our results of operations for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. As a result of the above factors, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our retail locations in new markets or acquiring new businesses, product lines or categories on a profitable basis, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability.. Since January 1, 2012, we have acquired 51 Camping World retail locations, nine Outdoor and Active Sports Retail locations, and two Overton's retail locations; opened two Gander Outdoors locations; and sold two Camping World retail locations. Each acquired retail location operated independently prior to its acquisition by us. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions and to integrate the operations of acquired retail locations, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that promote cooperation and the sharing of opportunities and resources among our retail locations and consumer services and plans. Unforeseen expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability.. We also may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria. Acquisitions also may become more difficult or less attractive in the future as we continue to acquire the most attractive dealers and stores. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of acquired dealers and stores with our own operations or managing acquired dealers and stores profitably without substantial costs, delays, or other operational or financial problems.. Our ability to continue to grow through the acquisition of additional retail locations will depend upon various factors, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive purchase prices;. 34. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of cash on hand, borrowed funds or Class A common stock with a sufficient market price to finance the acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to obtain any requisite third-party or governmental approvals; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe absence of one or more third parties attempting to impose unsatisfactory restrictions on us in connection with their approval of acquisitions.. As a part of our acquisition strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with various dealerships and other Outdoor and Active Sports Retail businesses regarding their potential acquisition by us. In connection with these discussions, we and each potential acquisition candidate exchange confidential operational and financial information, conduct due diligence inquiries, and consider the structure, terms, and conditions of the potential acquisition. Potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues, including in some cases, management succession and related matters. As a result of these and other factors, a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated. In addition, we may have disagreements with potential acquisition targets, which could lead to litigation. Any of these factors or outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Failure to maintain the strength and value of our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends on the value and strength of our key brands, including Good Sam, Camping World, Gander Outdoors and Overton's. These brands are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality services, protection plans, products and resources and a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations, if we are subject to publicized litigation or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Some of these risks may be beyond our ability to control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding our manufacturers, suppliers or third-party providers of services or negative publicity related to members of management. Any of these events could result in decreases in revenues. Further, maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands image may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, store operations, community relations, store graphics and employee training, which could adversely affect our cash flow and which may ultimately be unsuccessful. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our failure to successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect consumer demand in a volatile market and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products appeal to consumers who are, or could become, RV owners and/or outdoor and active sports enthusiasts across North America. The preferences of these consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Further, the retail consumer industry, by its nature, is volatile and sensitive to numerous economic factors, including consumer preferences, competition, market conditions, general economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. We cannot predict consumer preferences with certainty, and consumer preferences often change over time. We typically order merchandise well in advance of the following selling season. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends, increases or decreases in consumer demand or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our consumers' purchasing habits in the future, our. 35. Table of Contents. revenues may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy consumer demand or sales orders or we may be required to discount excess inventory, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our same store sales may fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.. Our same store sales may vary from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our same store sales results, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges or anticipated changes to regulations related to some of the products we sell;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to identify and respond effectively to local and regional trends and customer preferences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to provide quality customer service that will increase our conversion of shoppers into paying customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition in the regional market of a store;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tatypical weather patterns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our product mix;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges to local or regional regulations affecting our stores;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in sales of consumer services and plans and retention and renewal rates for our annually renewing consumer services and plans; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in pricing and average unit sales.. An unanticipated decline in revenues or same store sales may cause the price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly.. The cyclical nature of our business has caused our sales and results of operations to fluctuate. These fluctuations may continue in the future, which could result in operating losses during downturns.. The RV, outdoor and active sports specialty retail industries are cyclical and are influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tterms and availability of financing for retailers and consumers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpopulation and employment trends;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincome levels; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral economic conditions, including inflation, deflation and recessions.. As a result of the foregoing factors, our sales and results of operations have fluctuated, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future.. 36. Table of Contents. Our business is seasonal and this leads to fluctuations in sales and revenues.. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in revenue, net income and cash flows as a result of annual seasonality in our business. Because RVs are used primarily by vacationers and campers, demand for services, protection plans, products and resources generally declines during the winter season, while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Conversely, we expect demand for non-RV related outdoor and active sports products to generally decline during the first and second fiscal quarters and we expect sales and profits for our outdoor and active sports products to generally be higher in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. In addition, unusually severe weather conditions in some geographic areas may impact demand.. On average, over the three years ended December 31, 2017, we have generated 30.1% and 28.6% of our annual revenue in the second and third fiscal quarters, respectively, which include the spring and summer months. We have historically incurred additional expenses in the second and third fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes, increased staffing in our retail locations and program costs. If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products or our product mix during the second and third fiscal quarters, our sales in these quarters could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Additionally, SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of acquisitions and the seasonality of our business. We prefer to acquire new retail locations in the first and fourth quarters of each year in order to provide time for the location to be re-modeled and to ramp up operations ahead of the spring and summer months. The timing of our acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters, coupled with generally lower revenue in these quarters has resulted in SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit being higher in these quarters. In 2018, we plan to open 72 additional Gander Outdoors locations by May 2018, which we expect to further impact this trend.. Due to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from other risks associated with our business, including atypical weather, consumer spending levels and general business conditions, is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our peak sales seasons.. Our ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.. The operation of our business, the rate of our expansion and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. We also require sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations under our existing debt agreements. As of December 31, 2017, we had a credit agreement that included a $945.0 million term loan (the \"Existing Term Loan Facility\") and $35.0 million of commitments for revolving loans and letters of credit (the \"Existing Revolving Credit Facility\" and, together with the Existing Term Loan Facility, the \"Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities\"). Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, we also had up to $1.415 billion in maximum borrowing availability under the Floor Plan Facility. The Floor Plan Facility also provides a letter of credit commitment of $15.0 million and a $35.0 million revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $916.9 million of term loans outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, net of $6.0 million of unamortized original issue discount and $14.2 million of finance costs, no revolving borrowings outstanding under the Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities aside from letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $3.2 million outstanding under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility, and $974.0 million in floor plan notes payable outstanding under the Floor Plan Facility, with $31.8 million of additional borrowing capacity under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, $226.4 million of available line for future inventory purchases under our Floor Plan Facility, and no revolving borrowings outstanding under the Floor Plan Facility revolving line of credit. The proceeds from the Existing Term Loan Facility were used to repay the Company's previous senior secured credit facilities (\"Previous Senior Secured Credit Facilities\").. Our Existing Term Loan Facility, which we entered into on November 8, 2016, as amended on March 17, 2017 and October 6, 2017, requires us to make quarterly principal payments of $2.4 million. We paid total. 37. Table of Contents. cash interest on our Existing Term Facility of $37.6 million and $45,000 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also paid total cash interest on our Previous Senior Secured Credit Facilities of $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We paid total floor plan interest on our Floor Plan Facility of $26.8 million and $18.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition to interest paid on our Existing Senior Credit Facilities, our Previous Senior Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility, we paid cash interest of $0.8 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Existing Term Loan Facility also provides for an excess cash flow payment following the end of each fiscal year beginning with our fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 such that our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, CWGS Group, LLC (the \"Borrower\"), will be required to prepay the term loan borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of excess cash flow for such fiscal year if the total leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1.00. The required percentage of excess cash flow prepayment is reduced to 25% if the total leverage ratio is 1.50 to 1.00 or greater, but less than 2.00 to 1.00, and 0% if the total leverage ratio is less than 1.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2017, CWGS Group, LLC had no Excess Cash Flow, as defined. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Liquidity and Capital Resources  -  Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility\" in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K and Note 7  -  Long-Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. We are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to finance our new and certain of our used RV inventory under our Floor Plan Facility. Floor plan financing arrangements allow us to borrow money to buy a particular new RV from the manufacturer or a used RV on trade in or at auction and pay off the loan when we sell that particular RV. We may need to increase the capacity of our existing Floor Plan Facility in connection with our acquisition of dealerships and overall growth. In the event that we are unable to obtain such incremental financing, our ability to complete acquisitions could be limited.. We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations or cash available under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility or our Floor Plan Facility will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility or our Floor Plan Facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We currently intend to increase our borrowings in the near term to fund our current plan to open an additional 72 Gander Outdoors stores by May 2018, and to provide working capital for dealership acquisition opportunities. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.. Our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to access sufficient capital and operate our business.. Our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility contain various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur certain liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate or merge;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\talter the business conducted by us and our subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into certain sale and leaseback transactions;. 38. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpay dividends on capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire capital stock or certain other indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in transactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends.. In addition, the restrictive covenants in our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  -  Liquidity and Capital Resources  -  Description of Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Floor Plan Facility\" in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K and Note 7  -  Long-Term Debt to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and our failure to comply with these ratios could result in an event of default.. These covenants may affect our ability to operate and finance our business as we deem appropriate. Our inability to meet obligations as they become due or to comply with various financial covenants contained in the instruments governing our current or future indebtedness could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness.. If there were an event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness, the holders of the affected indebtedness could declare all of the affected indebtedness immediately due and payable, which, in turn, could cause the acceleration of the maturity of all our other indebtedness. We may not have sufficient funds available, or we may not have access to sufficient capital from other sources, to repay any accelerated debt. Even if we could obtain additional financing, the terms of the financing may not be favorable to us. In addition, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens securing our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility. If amounts outstanding under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility were accelerated, our lenders could foreclose on these liens and we could lose substantially all of our assets. Any event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We primarily rely on seven fulfillment and distribution centers for our retail, e - commerce and catalog businesses, and, if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at either facility, we may be unable to deliver merchandise effectively to our stores or customers.. We currently rely on seven distribution and fulfillment centers located in Franklin, Kentucky, Bakersfield, California, Fort Worth, Texas, Greenville, South Carolina, Lebanon, Indiana, St. Paul, Minnesota and Skokie, Illinois for our retail, e - commerce and catalog businesses. We handle almost all of our e - commerce and catalog orders and distribution to our retail stores through these seven facilities. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption at either facility due to fire, tornado, earthquake, flood or any other cause could damage our on - site inventory or impair our ability to use such distribution and fulfillment center. While we maintain business interruption insurance, as well as general property insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses in such an event. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores or fulfill customer orders and harm our results of operations.. Natural disasters, whether or not caused by climate change, unusual weather condition, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods, hail storms and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika virus or measles, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our stores are located could adversely affect our business and result in lower sales. Severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores or utilizing our products, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. Natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, hail storms and earthquakes may damage our stores or other operations, which may. 39. Table of Contents. materially adversely affect our consolidated financial results. In addition to business interruption, our retailing business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the concentration of property at our retail locations. To the extent these events also impact one or more of our key suppliers or result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers or our corporate headquarters, we may be unable to maintain inventory balances, maintain delivery schedules or provide other support functions to our stores. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We depend on our relationships with third-party providers of services, protection plans, products and resources and a disruption of these relationships or of these providers' operations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Our business depends in part on developing and maintaining productive relationships with third-party providers of services, protection plans, products and resources that we market to our customers. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we sourced our products from approximately 3,700 domestic and international vendors. Additionally, we rely on certain third-party providers to support our services, protection plans, products and resources, including insurance carriers for our property and casualty insurance and extended service contracts, banks and captive financing companies for vehicle financing and refinancing, Comenity Capital Bank as the issuer of our co - branded credit card and a tow provider network for our roadside assistance programs. We cannot accurately predict when, or the extent to which, we will experience any disruption in the supply of products from our vendors or services from our third-party providers. Any such disruption could negatively impact our ability to market and sell our services, protection plans, products and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Comenity Capital Bank could decline to renew our services agreement or become insolvent and unable to perform our contract, and we may be unable to timely find a replacement bank to provide these services.. We depend on merchandise purchased from our vendors to obtain products for our retail locations. We have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply from our key vendors, and our vendors may discontinue selling to us at any time. Changes in commercial practices of our key vendors or manufacturers, such as changes in vendor support and incentives or changes in credit or payment terms, could also negatively impact our results. If we lose one or more key vendors or are unable to promptly replace a vendor that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products at comparable prices, we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment.. Because certain of the products that we sell are manufactured abroad, we may face delays, and increased cost or quality control deficiencies in the importation of these products, which could reduce our net sales and profitability.. Like many other outdoor and active sports oriented retailers, a portion of the products that we purchase for resale, including those purchased from domestic suppliers, is manufactured abroad in China and other countries. In addition, we believe most of our private label merchandise is manufactured abroad. Foreign imports subject us to the risks of changes in, or the imposition of new, import tariffs, duties or quotas, new restrictions on imports, loss of \"most favored nation\" status with the United States for a particular foreign country, antidumping or countervailing duty orders, retaliatory actions in response to illegal trade practices, work stoppages, delays in shipment, freight expense increases, product cost increases due to foreign currency fluctuations or revaluations and economic uncertainties. If any of these or other factors were to cause a disruption of trade from the countries in which the suppliers of our vendors are located or impose additional costs in connection with the purchase of our products, we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of products to satisfy our requirements and our results of operations could be adversely affected.. To the extent that any foreign manufacturers which supply products to us directly or indirectly utilize quality control standards, labor practices or other practices that vary from those legally mandated or commonly accepted in the United States, we could be hurt by any resulting negative publicity or, in some cases, face potential liability.. 40. Table of Contents. In addition, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which our vendors or we obtain our products, or general international instability, could have an adverse effect on our operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, merchandise purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the merchandise we currently purchase abroad.. We also are subject to risks, such as the price and availability of raw materials and fabrics, labor disputes, union organizing activity, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters, war and terrorism and adverse general economic and political conditions that might limit our vendors' ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely and cost - efficient basis. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently purchase. Any delay or failure in offering quality products and services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We offer emergency roadside assistance to our customers at a fixed price per year and we pay our tow provider network based on usage. If the amount of emergency roadside claims substantially exceeds our estimates or if our tow provider is unable to adequately respond to calls, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. With respect to the insurance programs that we offer, we are dependent on the insurance carriers that underwrite the insurance to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and maintain compliance with insurance regulations. If such carriers do not obtain appropriate state regulatory approvals or comply with such changing regulations, we may be required to use an alternative carrier or change our insurance products or cease marketing certain insurance related products in certain states, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to use an alternative insurance carrier or change our insurance related products, it may materially increase the time required to bring an insurance related product to market. Any disruption in our service offerings could harm our reputation and result in customer dissatisfaction.. Additionally, we provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers ceases to provide financing to our customers, provides financing to fewer customers or no longer provides financing on competitive terms, or if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We also offer a co - branded credit card issued by Comenity Capital Bank, a third-party bank that manages and directly extends credit to our customers. The cardholders can earn promotional points on a variety of qualifying purchases, such as purchases at Camping World, Gander Outdoors, Overton's, Uncle Dan's and TheHouse.com on Good Sam purchases and at private campgrounds across the United States and Canada. We earn incentive payments from our card network partner based on the use of the credit card. A decrease in the popularity and use of our co - branded credit card could reduce our ability to earn incentive payment income as part of the program and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A portion of our net income is from financing, insurance and extended service contracts, which depend on third-party lenders and insurance companies. We cannot assure you third-party lending institutions will continue to provide financing for RV purchases.. A portion of our net income comes from the fees we receive from lending institutions and insurance companies for arranging financing and insurance coverage for our customers. The lending institution pays us a fee for each loan that we arrange. If these lenders were to lend to our customers directly rather than through us, we would not receive a fee. In addition, if customers prepay financing we arranged within a specified period (generally within six months of making the loan), we are required to rebate (or \"chargeback\") all or a portion of the commissions paid to us by the lending institution. Our revenues from financing fees and vehicle service contract fees are recorded net of a reserve for estimated future chargebacks based on historical operating results. Lending institutions may change the criteria or terms they use to make loan. 41. Table of Contents. decisions, which could reduce the number of customers for whom we can arrange financing, or may elect to not continue to provide these products with respect to RVs. Our customers may also use the internet or other electronic methods to find financing alternatives. If any of these events occur, we could lose a significant portion of our income and profit.. Furthermore, new and used vehicles may be sold and financed through retail installment sales contracts entered into between us and third - party purchasers. Prior to entering into a retail installment sales contract with a third - party purchaser, we typically have a commitment from a third - party lender for the assignment of such retail installment sales contract, subject to final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically assigned by us to third - party lenders simultaneously with the execution of the retail installment sales contracts. Contracts in transit represent amounts due from third - party lenders from whom pre - arranged assignment agreements have been determined, and to whom the retail installment sales contract have been assigned. We recognize revenue when the applicable new or used vehicle is delivered and we have assigned the retail installment sales contract to a third - party lender and collectability is reasonably assured. Funding from the third - party lender is provided upon receipt, final review, approval and verification of the retail installment sales contract, related documentation and the information contained therein. Retail installment sales contracts are typically funded within ten days of the initial approval of the retail installment sales contract by the third - party lender. Contracts in transit are included in current assets in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K and totaled $46.2 million and $29.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Any defaults on these retail installment sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we are unable to retain senior executives and attract and retain other qualified employees, our business might be adversely affected.. Our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is high. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully and, in such an event, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Marcus Lemonis. The loss of any member of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our business plan and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, certain members of our management team, including Mr. Lemonis, currently pursue and may continue to pursue other business ventures, which could divert their attention from executing on our business plan and objectives. We do not currently maintain key - man life insurance policies on any member of our senior management team or other key employees. We have entered into employment agreements with Marcus A. Lemonis, our Chief Executive Officer, Thomas F. Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, Brent L. Moody, our Chief Operating and Legal Officer, and Roger L. Nuttall, our President of Camping World.. Our business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs.. Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including market managers, general managers, sales managers, department managers and sales associates. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the retail industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and knowledge of our merchandise, our business could be materially adversely affected. Although none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay the planned openings of new stores. Any such delays, any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. 42. Table of Contents. We are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space.. We lease substantially all of the real properties where we have operations, including, as of December 31, 2017, 133 of our 140 of our Camping World retail locations in 36 states, two Gander Outdoors retail locations, two Overton's locations, three Uncle Dan's locations and our six RV retail distribution centers. Our leases generally provide for fixed monthly rentals with escalation clauses and range from five to twenty years. The profitability of our business is heavily dependent on operating our current store base with favorable margins, opening and operating new stores at reasonable profit, renewing leases for stores in desirable locations and, if necessary, identifying and closing underperforming stores or potentially relocating these stores to alternative locations in a cost-effective manner. Typically, a large portion of a store's operating expense is the cost associated with leasing the location.. The operating leases for our retail properties, distribution centers and corporate offices expire at various dates through 2050. A number of leases have renewal options for various periods of time at our discretion. We are typically responsible for taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs, and maintenance for these properties. Rent expense for 2017 was $86.6 million and our future minimum rental commitments for 2018 for all operating leases in existence as of December 31, 2017 is approximately $101.3 million, which does not include rent for Gander Outdoors stores where the lease was signed in 2018. The rental commitment for the fiscal years 2018 through 2050 is approximately $1.2 billion. We expect that many of the new stores we open will also be leased to us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenditures and require significant capital expenditures. We depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cashflow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facility, we may not be able to service our lease expenses or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would materially affect our business. In addition, when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in locations that may be desirable. We may be unable to relocate these stores cost-effectively or at all and there can be no assurance that any relocated stores will be successful.. Additionally, over time our current store locations may not continue to be desirable because of changes in demographics within the surrounding area or a decline in shopping traffic, including traffic generated by other nearby stores. Although we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making certain payments, we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so. If we decide to close stores, we are generally required to either continue to pay rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or, for certain locations, pay exercise rights to terminate, which in either case could be expensive. Even if we are able to assign or sublease vacated locations where our lease cannot be terminated, we may remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform.. If we are unable to service our lease expenses or are unable to, on favorable terms, negotiate renewals of leases at desirable locations or identify and close underperforming locations, we may be forced to seek alternative sites in our target markets, which may be difficult and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations.. Our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal, state and local regulation, including our RV sales, firearms sales, RV financing, outbound telemarketing, direct mail, roadside assistance programs and insurance activities. New regulatory efforts may be proposed from time to time that have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our businesses or our results of operations. For example, in the past a principal source of leads for our direct response marketing efforts was new vehicle registrations provided by motor vehicle departments in various states. Currently, all states restrict access to motor vehicle registration information.. We are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation and marketing of motor vehicles, including so - called. 43. Table of Contents. \"lemon laws.\" Federal, state and local laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length and width of motor vehicles that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions. Federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution and hazardous waste generation and disposal which affect our business and operations.. Further, certain federal and state laws and regulations affect our activities. Areas of our business affected by such laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, labor, advertising, consumer protection, real estate, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property, tax, import and export, anti - corruption, anti - competition, environmental, health and safety. Compliance with these laws and others may be onerous and costly, at times, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction which further complicates compliance efforts.. The Dodd - Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd - Frank Act\"), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \"CFPB\"), an independent federal agency funded by the United States Federal Reserve with broad regulatory powers and limited oversight from the United States Congress. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd - Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of automotive dealers, in particular, their sale and marketing of finance and insurance products, through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions. In March 2013, the CFPB issued supervisory guidance highlighting its concern that the practice of automotive dealers being compensated for arranging customer financing through discretionary markup of wholesale rates offered by financial institutions (dealer markup) results in a significant risk of pricing disparity in violation of The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the \"ECOA\"). The CFPB recommended that financial institutions under its jurisdiction take steps to address compliance with the ECOA, which may include imposing controls on dealer markup, monitoring and addressing the effects of dealer markup policies, and eliminating dealer discretion to markup buy rates and fairly compensating dealers using a different mechanism that does not result in disparate impact to certain groups of consumers.. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \"Affordable Care Act\"), which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, may increase our annual employee health care costs that we fund and has increased our cost of compliance and compliance risk related to offering health care benefits.. Furthermore, our property and casualty insurance programs that we offer through third-party insurance carriers are subject to various state laws and regulations governing the business of insurance, including, without limitation, laws and regulations governing the administration, underwriting, marketing, solicitation or sale of insurance programs. Our third-party insurance carriers are required to apply for, renew, and maintain licenses issued by state, federal or foreign regulatory authorities. Such regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke such licenses. Accordingly, any failure by such parties to comply with the then current licensing requirements, which may include any determination of financial instability by such regulatory authorities, could result in such regulators denying their initial or renewal applications for such licenses, modifying the terms of licenses or revoking licenses that they currently possess, which could severely inhibit our ability to market these products. Additionally, certain state laws and regulations govern the form and content of certain disclosures that must be made in connection with the sale, advertising or offer of any insurance program to a consumer. We review all marketing materials we disseminate to the public for compliance with applicable insurance regulations. We are required to maintain certain licenses and approvals in order to market insurance programs.. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF. If we fail to comply with ATF rules and regulations, the ATF may limit our growth or business activities, levy fines against us or, ultimately, revoke our license to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition and firearms, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:. 븈equire the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing or selling firearms and ammunition as a business;.  require background checks for purchasers of firearms;. 44. Table of Contents. 뷼mpose waiting periods between the purchase of a firearm and delivery of a firearm;. 븆rohibit the sale of firearms to certain persons, such as those below a certain age and persons with criminal records;  regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials;. 븈egulate the interstate sale of certain firearms;. 븆rohibit the interstate mail-order sale of firearms;. 븈egulate our employment of personnel with criminal convictions; and. 븈estrict access to firearm manufacturing facilities for individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions.. Several states currently have laws in effect that are similar to, and in certain cases, more restrictive than, these federal laws. Compliance with all of these regulations is costly and time-consuming. Inadvertent violation of any of these regulations could cause us to incur fines and penalties and may also lead to restrictions on our ability to manufacture and sell our products and services and to import or export the products we sell.. We have instituted various and comprehensive policies and procedures to address compliance. However, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, vendors or our agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. For more information on the various regulations applicable to our business, see \"Item I. Business - Government Regulation\" under Part I of this Form 10-K.. Regulations applicable to the sale of extended service contracts could materially impact our business and results of operations.. We offer extended service contracts that may be purchased as a supplement to the original purchaser's warranty. These products are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered will not seek to regulate or restrict these products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of the warranty products in one or more jurisdictions. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We currently transfer the majority of the administration and liability obligations associated with these extended service contracts to a third party upon purchase by the customer. State laws and regulations, however, may limit or condition our ability to transfer these administration and liability obligations to third parties, which could in turn impact the way revenue is recognized from these products. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines or other penalties, including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of these product offerings as currently structured. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If state dealer laws are repealed or weakened, our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, non - renewal or renegotiation of dealer agreements.. State dealer laws generally provide that a manufacturer may not terminate or refuse to renew a dealer agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non - renewal. Some state dealer laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or attempt to comply with the manufacturer's criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non - renewal. Though unsuccessful to date, manufacturers' lobbying efforts may lead to the repeal or revision of state dealer laws. If dealer laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our dealer agreements without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of state dealer laws, it may also be more difficult for our dealerships to renew their dealer agreements upon expiration.. 45. Table of Contents. The ability of a manufacturer to grant additional dealer agreements is based on several factors which are not within our control. If manufacturers grant new dealer agreements in areas near or within our existing markets, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Changes in government policies and firearms legislation could adversely affect our financial results.. The sale, purchase, ownership and use of firearms are subject to numerous and varied federal, state and local governmental regulations. Federal laws governing firearms include the National Firearms Act, the Federal Firearms Act, the Arms Export Control Act and the Gun Control Act of 1968. These laws generally govern the manufacture, import, export, sale and possession of firearms and ammunition.. Currently, some members of the federal legislature and several state legislatures are considering additional legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition. These proposed bills are extremely varied. If enacted, such legislation could effectively ban or severely limit the sale of affected firearms or ammunition. In addition, if such restrictions are enacted and are incongruent, we could find it difficult, expensive or even practically impossible to comply with them, which could impede new product development and the distribution of existing products. We cannot assure you that the regulation of our business activities will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction will not have a material adverse effect on our business. For more information on the government policies and firearms legislation applicable to our business, see \"Item I. Business - Government Regulation - Firearms Laws and Regulations\" under Part I of this Form 10-K.. Our failure to comply with certain environmental regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our operations involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling and/or disposal of materials such as motor oil and filters, transmission fluids, antifreeze, refrigerants, paints, thinners, batteries, cleaning products, lubricants, degreasing agents, tires and propane. Consequently, our business is subject to a complex variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety and we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements. Our failure to comply with these regulations could cause us to become subject to fines and penalties or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we have indemnified certain of our landlords for any hazardous waste which may be found on or about property we lease. If any such hazardous waste were to be found on property that we occupy, a significant claim giving rise to our indemnity obligation could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of \"greenhouse gases\" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the RVs we sell.. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. The adoption of any laws or regulations requiring significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on vehicles and automotive fuels in the United States could adversely affect demand for those vehicles and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. A failure in our e - commerce operations, security breaches and cybersecurity risks could disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales and growth prospects and reputational damage.. Our e - commerce business is an important element of our brands and relationship with our customers, and we expect it to continue to grow. In addition to changing consumer preferences and shifting traffic patterns and buying trends in e - commerce, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with e - commerce sales, including rapid changes in technology, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, cyber - attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could. 46. Table of Contents. reduce our e - commerce sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage our brands, which could negatively impact our results of operations and stock price.. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to expand our e - commerce business. Our competitors may have e - commerce businesses that are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which places us at a competitive disadvantage. Although we continually update our websites, we may not be successful in implementing improved website features and there is no guarantee that such improvements will expand our e - commerce business. If we are unable to expand our e - commerce business, our growth plans will suffer and the price of our common stock could decline.. We may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights and we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We own a variety of registered trademarks and service marks for the names of our clubs, magazines and other publications. We also own the copyrights to certain articles in our publications. We believe that our trademark and copyrights have significant value and are important to our marketing efforts. If we are unable to continue to protect the trademarks and service marks for our proprietary brands, if such marks become generic or if third parties adopt marks similar to our marks, our ability to differentiate our products and services may be diminished. In the event that our trademarks or service marks are successfully challenged by third parties, we could lose brand recognition and be forced to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing new brands for our products.. From time to time, we may be compelled to protect our intellectual property, which may involve litigation. Such litigation may be time - consuming, expensive and distract our management from running the day - to - day operations of our business, and could result in the impairment or loss of the involved intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including litigation when necessary, will be successful. The loss or reduction of any of our significant intellectual property rights could diminish our ability to distinguish our products from competitors' products and retain our market share for our proprietary products. Our inability to effectively protect our proprietary intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information technology systems or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.. We depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain hardware, telecommunications and software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. Various components of our information technology systems, including hardware, networks, and software, are licensed to us by third-party vendors. We rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Additionally, because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the \"PCI Standard\"), issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. The PCI Standard contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data. We are currently in compliance with the PCI Standard, however, complying with the PCI Standard and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to maintain compliance with the PCI Standard or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our. 47. Table of Contents. payment - related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Any disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations, compromise our reputation, expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We rely on the integrity, security and successful functioning of our information technology systems and network infrastructure across our operations. We use information technology systems to support our consumer services and plans, manage procurement and our supply chain, track inventory information at our retail locations, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. We also use information systems to report and audit our operational results.. In connection with sales, we transmit encrypted confidential credit and debit card information. Although we are currently in compliance with the PCI Standard, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to continue to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with PCI or other industry recommended or contractually required practices. Even if we continue to be compliant with such standards, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches.. We also have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, associates and suppliers, as well as our business. For example, we have over 15.1 million unique RV contacts in our database, plus an additional 4.5 million from the Gander Outdoors and Overton's businesses, as of December 31, 2017. This customer database includes information about our approximately 1.8 million club members and our 3.6 million RV Active Customers as of December 31, 2017. In addition, the protection of our customer, club member, associate, supplier and company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements across our business. In addition, customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyber - attack or other security breaches. We have procedures in place to safeguard such data and information. However, a significant breach of club member, customer, employee, supplier, or company data could attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our club member, customer and supplier relationships and our reputation, and result in lost sales, fines and/or lawsuits.. An increasingly significant portion of our sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including but not limited to our point - of - sale system and our credit card processing systems. Our information technology, communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, acts of war or terrorist attacks, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss and outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, unauthorized data breaches, usage errors by our associates or our contractors or other attempts to harm our systems, including cyber - security attacks, hacking by third parties, computer viruses or other breaches of cardholder data. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, intentional sabotage or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services and non - compliance with certain regulations or expose us to risk of litigation and liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we have centralized the majority of our computer systems in our facilities in Englewood, Colorado and Bowling Green, Kentucky. It is possible that an event or disaster at our facilities in Englewood, Colorado and Bowling Green, Kentucky could materially and adversely affect the performance of our company and the ability of each of our stores to operate efficiently.. Increases in the minimum wage could adversely affect our financial results.. From time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the minimum wage in a number of individual states. As federal or state minimum wage rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees, but. 48. Table of Contents. also the wages paid to our other hourly employees as well. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.. Increases in paper costs, postage costs and shipping costs may have an adverse impact on our future financial results.. The price of paper is a significant expense relating to our publications and direct mail solicitations. Postage for publication distribution and direct mail solicitations is also a significant expense. In addition, shipping costs are a significant expense for our business. Paper, postage and shipping costs have increased in the past and may be expected to increase in the future. Such increases could have an adverse effect on our business if we are unable to pass them on to our customers.. We may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.. Some of the products we sell may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused property damage or personal injury could damage our brand identity and our reputation with existing and potential consumers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We have a self - insured retention (\"SIR\") for products liability and personal injury matters ranging from $25,000 to $500,000 depending on the product type and when the occurrence took place. Generally, any occurrence (as defined by our insurance policies) after June 1, 2007 is subject to the $500,000 SIR. Amounts above the SIR, up to a certain dollar amount, are covered by our excess insurance policy. Currently, we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating $150.0 million with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of our self - insured positions for products liability and personal injury matters. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to increase significantly and may negatively impact future SIR levels. It may also increase the amounts we pay in punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance.. We may be named in litigation, which may result in substantial costs and reputational harm and divert management's attention and resources.. We face legal risks in our business, including claims from disputes with our employees and our former employees and claims associated with general commercial disputes, product liability and other matters. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. While we maintain director and officer insurance, as well as general and product liability insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured. We have been named in the past and may be named in the future as defendants of class action lawsuits. For example, we were named as a defendant in a class action lawsuit by Camp Coast to Coast club members, which alleged certain violations of California's Unfair Competition Law at Business and Professions Code and other laws, relating to our sale of trip points and certain advertising and marketing materials. In addition, we were also named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit filed by former employees in the State of California, which alleged various wage and hour claims under the California Labor Code. We have since settled both actions. Regardless of their subject matter or merits, class action lawsuits may result in significant cost to us, which may not be covered by insurance, may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Negative publicity from litigation, whether or not resulting in a substantial cost, could materially damage our reputation. We may in the future be the target of litigation and this litigation may result in substantial costs and reputational harm and divert. 49. Table of Contents. management's attention and resources. Costs, harm to our reputation and diversion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our private brand offerings expose us to various risks.. We expect to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings through a combination of brands that we own and brands that we license from third parties. We have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers at each price point and provide us with higher gross margins than comparable third-party branded products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain specific risks in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this section, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential mandatory or voluntary product recalls;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights (including defending against counterfeit, knock offs, grey - market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized goods);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to successfully administer and comply with obligations under license agreements that we have with the licensors of brands, including, in some instances, certain minimum sales requirements that, if not met, could cause us to lose the licensing rights or pay damages; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tother risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail.. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors' products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationship with our vendors. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Political and economic uncertainty and unrest in foreign countries where some of our merchandise vendors are located and trade restrictions upon imports from these foreign countries could adversely affect our ability to source merchandise and our results of operations.. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 5% and 8%, respectively, of our merchandise was imported directly from vendors located in foreign countries, with a substantial portion of the imported merchandise being obtained directly from vendors in China. In addition, we believe that a significant portion of our domestic vendors obtain their products from foreign countries that may also be subject to political and economic uncertainty. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic, political and other conditions in foreign countries where our vendors are located, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twork stoppages;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\teconomic uncertainties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse foreign government regulations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twars, fears of war and terrorist attacks and organizing activities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse fluctuations of foreign currencies;. 50. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical unrest.. We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the above events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our results of operations.. In addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against clothing items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes.. Our policies, procedures, controls and oversight to monitor and manage our enterprise risks may not be fully effective in achieving their purpose and may leave exposure to identified or unidentified risks. Past or future misconduct by our employees or vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational harm or financial harm. We monitor our policies, procedures and controls; however, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent all forms of misconduct. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall enterprise risk management program, but it is possible that our compensation policies could incentivize inappropriate risk taking or misconduct. If such inappropriate risks or misconduct occurs, it is possible that it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We could incur asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets or other long - lived assets.. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long - lived assets. At least annually, we review goodwill for impairment. Long - lived assets, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors. If the carrying value of a long - lived asset is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long - lived asset exceeds its fair value. Our determination of future cash flows, future recoverability and fair value of our long - lived assets includes significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in those estimates or assumptions or lower than anticipated future financial performance may result in the identification of an impaired asset and a non - cash impairment charge, which could be material. Any such charge could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. As we continue to open and operate existing Gander Outdoors retail locations, we may be required to raise additional funds in order to fund such openings. We cannot assure you that the terms of any additional debt or equity financing we obtain to fund the openings will be favorable to us.. In addition to our two Gander Outdoors and two Overton's stores that are already open as of December 31, 2017, contingent on our final lease negotiations, our current plan is to open an additional 72 Gander Outdoors stores by May 2018, with measured growth thereafter. As a result, we will begin to incur meaningful incremental expenses without the benefit of the full revenue as we further ramp the Gander Outdoors business and open additional stores. Given our lack of operating history of these store locations, we expect to be exposed to longer start up times to reach profitability than our traditional greenfield location openings. Additionally, there is no assurance that we will reach profitability with respect to these additional stores.. 51. Table of Contents. Based on our current plans, we currently expect to fund the opening and initial working capital needs of our Gander Outdoors stores and certain liabilities that we will assume in connection therewith with available cash on hand and proceeds from the Second Amendment to our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. We may also be required to raise additional capital from equity or debt financing to finance the opening and operation of Gander Outdoors stores. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Moreover, the issuance by us of Class A common stock in any future offerings may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, to the extent that we need to incur additional debt financing in connection with the opening and operation of any Gander Outdoors retail locations, such debt financings may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future.. Additionally, if we fail to realize the expected benefits from integrating Gander Outdoors and Overton's brands with our pre-existing businesses and opening and operating related retail locations, or if the financial performance of Gander Outdoors or Overton's does not meet our current expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt and our results of operations may fail to meet expectations.. We may not complete the opening of Gander Outdoors retail locations within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have a negative effect on our business and our results of operations.. In addition to our two Gander Outdoors and two Overton's stores that are already open as of December 31, 2017, contingent on our final lease negotiations, our current plan is to open an additional 72 Gander Outdoors stores by May 2018, with measured growth thereafter. As a result, we will begin to incur meaningful incremental expenses without the benefit of the full revenue as we begin to further ramp the Gander Outdoors business and open additional stores. Additionally, given the liquidation of the Gander Outdoors inventory prior to opening these additional stores, we will need to supply each retail location that we determine to operate with new inventory in a timely manner, which may also require us to raise additional capital from equity or debt financings. If we are unable to negotiate lease terms with the landlords acceptable to us, order new inventory or raise additional capital, in each case, within the expected time frame, or at all, it could have a negative effect on our financial performance and our ability to execute on our operating strategy for Gander Outdoors.. Opening and operating Gander Outdoors and Overton's retail locations may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of integrating Gander Outdoors and Overton's brands into our pre-existing businesses may not be fully realized.. The success of Gander Outdoors and Overton's brands, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings from integrating the two brands with our pre-existing businesses, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the businesses of Gander Outdoors and Overton's with our pre-existing businesses. The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our existing business in the markets in which Gander Outdoors and Overton's operate, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our Class A common stock. Other potential difficulties of integrating the businesses of Gander Outdoors and Overton's with our pre-existing businesses include unanticipated issues in integrating suppliers, logistics, distribution, retail operations, negotiation of lease terms with landlords on terms acceptable to us, information communications and other systems. We also expect to continue to incur non-recurring charges, including transaction costs, directly attributable to the integration of Gander Outdoors and Overton's brands, as well as the opening of related retail locations.. 52. Table of Contents. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the opening and operating Gander Outdoors and Overton's locations may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Gander Outdoors, Overton's and our pre-existing businesses during this transition period and on the combined company afterwards.. Moreover, in connection with the opening of the Gander Outdoors and Overton's retail locations, we expect that we will continue to expand into numerous new markets and will be selling various new product lines or categories, including firearms. See \" -  We may incur costs from litigation relating to products that we currently sell as a result of opening and operating Gander Outdoors and Overton's retail locations, particularly firearms and ammunition products, which could adversely affect our total revenue and profitability.\" As a result, opening retail locations may be more costly or time consuming than expected. Additionally, our unfamiliarity with the Gander Outdoors and Overton's product lines and new markets may also impact our ability to operate these locations profitably once they are opened. Other factors that may impact the profitability of these retail locations include our ability to retain existing store personnel or hire and train new store personnel, especially management personnel, our ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise, our ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements, our ability to supply retail locations with inventory in a timely manner and the other factors described under \" -  Risks Related to our Business  -  Our expansion into new, unfamiliar markets, products lines or categories presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new markets, products lines or categories. Delays in opening or acquiring new retail locations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\" under ''Risk Factors'' in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating the Gander Outdoors and Overton's businesses on a profitable basis, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may incur costs from litigation relating to products that we currently sell as a result of the Gander Mountain acquisition and the opening of retail locations, particularly firearms and ammunition, which could adversely affect our total revenue and profitability.. We may incur damages due to lawsuits relating to products we currently sell as a result of the Gander Mountain acquisition and the opening of the rebranded Gander Outdoors retail locations, including, but not limited to, lawsuits relating to firearms, ammunition, tree stands and archery equipment. We may incur losses due to lawsuits, including potential class actions, relating to our performance of background checks on firearms purchases and compliance with other sales laws as mandated by state and federal law. We may also incur losses from lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms or ammunition sold by us, including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from manufacturers and retailers of firearms and ammunition. Our insurance coverage and the insurance provided by our vendors for certain products they sell to us may be inadequate to cover claims and liabilities related to products that we sell. In addition, claims or lawsuits related to products that we sell, or the unavailability of insurance for product liability claims, could result in the elimination of these products from our product line, thereby reducing total revenue. If one or more successful claims against us are not covered by or exceed our insurance coverage, or if insurance coverage is no longer available, our available working capital may be impaired and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our profitability and on future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies.. Risks Relating to Our Organizational Structure. Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, has substantial control over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and his interests, along with the interests of our other Continuing Equity Owners, in our business may conflict with yours.. Each share of our Class B common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally provided that, for as long as ML Acquisition Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, indirectly owned by each of Stephen Adams and our Chairman and Chief. 53. Table of Contents. Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis (\"ML Acquisition\") and its permitted transferees of common units (the \"ML Related Parties\"), directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate 27.5% or more of all of the outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC, the shares of our Class B common stock held by the ML Related Parties entitle the ML Related Parties, and, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition, Marcus Lemonis, to the number of votes necessary such that the ML Related Parties, in the aggregate, cast 47% of the total votes eligible to be cast by all of our stockholders on all matters presented to a vote of our stockholders generally. Additionally, our one share of Class C common stock entitles ML RV Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, wholly-owned by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Marcus Lemonis (\"ML RV Group\") and, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML RV Group, Marcus Lemonis, to the number of votes necessary such that he casts 5% of the total votes eligible to be cast by all of our stockholders on all matters presented to a vote of our stockholders generally for as long as there is no Class C Change of Control (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation). Accordingly, subject to the voting agreement that we entered into with ML Acquisition, ML RV Group, CVRV Acquisition LLC and CVRV Acquisition II LLC in connection with our IPO (the \"Voting Agreement\") as described below, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, may approve or disapprove substantially all transactions and other matters requiring approval by our stockholders, such as a merger, consolidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the issuance or redemption of certain additional equity interests, and the election of directors. These voting and class approval rights may also enable Marcus Lemonis to approve transactions that may not be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock or, conversely, prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.. Additionally, the Continuing Equity Owners may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon any redemption or exchange of their common units in CWGS, LLC, including the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the Continuing Equity Owners may conflict with the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. For example, the Continuing Equity Owners may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of the Continuing Equity Owners even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.. In addition, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, Crestview Advisors, L.L.C., a registered investment adviser to private equity funds, including funds affiliated with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. (\"Crestview\") has the right to designate certain of our directors (the \"Crestview Directors\"), which will be four Crestview Directors (unless Marcus Lemonis is no longer our Chief Executive Officer, in which case, Crestview will have the right to designate three Crestview Directors) for as long as Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 32.5% or more of our Class A common stock, three Crestview Directors for so long as Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than 32.5% but 25% or more of our Class A common stock, two Crestview Directors for as long as Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than 25% but 15% or more of our Class A common stock and one Crestview Director for as long as Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than 15% but 7.5% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming in each such case that all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one for one basis). Crestview currently has the right to designate two Crestview Directors. Each of ML Acquisition and ML RV Group has agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the Crestview Directors. In addition, the ML Related Parties also have the right to designate certain of our directors (the \"ML Acquisition Directors\"), which will be four ML Acquisition Directors for as long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate 27.5% or more of our Class A common stock, three ML Acquisition Directors for as long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 27.5% but 25% or more of our Class A common stock, two ML Acquisition Directors for as long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 25% but 15% or more of our Class A common stock. 54. Table of Contents. and one ML Acquisition Director for as long as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, less than 15% but 7.5% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming in each such case that all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one for one basis). Moreover, ML RV Group has the right to designate one director for as long as it holds our one share of Class C common stock (the \"ML RV Director\"). Funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. have agreed to vote, or cause to vote, all of their outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock at any annual or special meeting of stockholders in which directors are elected, so as to cause the election of the ML Acquisition Directors and the ML RV Director. Additionally, pursuant to the Voting Agreement, we are required to take commercially reasonable action to cause (i) the board of directors to be comprised at least of nine directors; (ii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to be included in the slate of nominees to be elected to the board of directors at the next annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected and at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Company thereafter at which a director's term expires; (iii) the individuals designated in accordance with the terms of the Voting Agreement to fill the applicable vacancies on the board of directors; and (iv) a ML Acquisition Director or the ML RV Director to be the chairperson of the board of directors (as defined in our amended and restated bylaws). The Voting Agreement allows for the board of directors to reject the nomination, appointment or election of a particular director if such nomination, appointment or election would constitute a breach of the board of directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders or does not otherwise comply with any requirements of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or the charter for, or related guidelines of, the board of directors' nominating and corporate governance committee.. The Voting Agreement further provides that, for so long as Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 22.5% or more of our Class A common stock, or the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 22.5% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming in each such case that all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one - for - one basis), the approval of Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. and the ML Related Parties, as applicable, will be required for certain corporate actions. These actions include: (1) a change of control; (2) acquisitions or dispositions of assets above $100 million; (3) the issuance of securities of Camping World Holdings, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (other than under equity incentive plans that have received the prior approval of our board of directors); (4) material amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; and (5) any change in the size of the board of directors. The Voting Agreement also provides that, for so long as either Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., directly or indirectly, beneficially owns, in the aggregate, 28% or more of our Class A common stock, or the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own, in the aggregate, 28% or more of our Class A common stock (assuming in each such case that all outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC are redeemed for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock, on a one - for - one basis), the approval of Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. and the ML Related Parties, as applicable, will be required for the hiring and termination of our Chief Executive Officer; provided, however, that the approval of Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., and the ML Related Parties, as applicable, is only required at such time as Marcus Lemonis no longer serves as our Chief Executive Officer. These rights may prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \"corporate opportunity\" does not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates.. The doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers or directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \"corporate opportunity\" does not apply with respect to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates. Any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates therefore has no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and has the right to either hold any corporate. 55. Table of Contents. opportunity for their (and their affiliates') own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us, including to any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates.. As a result, certain of our stockholders, directors and their respective affiliates are not prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively impact our business or prospects.. We are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE listing requirements and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.. Pursuant to the terms of the Voting Agreement, Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, and certain funds controlled by Crestview Partners II GP, L.P., in the aggregate, have more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, and, as a result, we are considered a \"controlled company\" for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") listing requirements. As such, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, an entirely independent nominating and corporate governance committee, an entirely independent compensation committee or to perform annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.. The corporate governance requirements and specifically the independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We have utilized, and intend to continue to utilize, certain exemptions afforded to a \"controlled company.\" As a result, we are not subject to certain corporate governance requirements, including that a majority of our board of directors consists of \"independent directors,\" as defined under the rules of the NYSE. In addition, we are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee or compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities or to conduct annual performance evaluations of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees and currently we do not have an entirely independent nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.. Our principal asset is our interest in CWGS, LLC, and accordingly, we depend on distributions from CWGS, LLC to pay dividends, taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. CWGS, LLC's ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.. We are a holding company and had no material assets as of December 31, 2017, other than our ownership of 36,749,072 common units, representing a 41.5% economic interest in the business of CWGS, LLC, and cash of $14.5 million. We have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of CWGS, LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from CWGS, LLC. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to dividend or distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in our debt instruments, will permit such dividends or distributions.. CWGS, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to any entity - level U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its common units, including us. As a result, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of CWGS, LLC. Under the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement, CWGS, LLC is obligated to make tax distributions to holders of its common units, including us, except to the extent such distributions would render. 56. Table of Contents. CWGS, LLC insolvent or are otherwise prohibited by law or our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities, our Floor Plan Facility or any of our future debt agreements. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, our interests in CWGS, LLC and related party agreements, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and expenses and costs of being a public company, all of which could be significant. We intend, as its managing member, to cause CWGS, LLC to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any ordinary course payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, CWGS, LLC's ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which CWGS, LLC is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering CWGS, LLC insolvent. If CWGS, LLC does not have sufficient funds to pay tax distributions or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If CWGS, LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired. See \" -  Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\". Our Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant.. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with CWGS, LLC, each of the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the purchase of common units from Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. in exchange for Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the IPO and the related corporate reorganization transactions and any future redemptions that are funded by Camping World Holdings, Inc. or exchanges of common units and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be significant. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, which tax reporting positions are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Any payments made by us to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore may accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned upon the Continuing Equity Owners or Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. maintaining a continued ownership interest in CWGS, LLC.. The amounts that we may be required to pay to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.. The Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, if we materially breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable Agreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor's obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become. 57. Table of Contents. immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.. As a result of the foregoing, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.. We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. under the Tax Receivable Agreements in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a Continuing Equity Owner or Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments from which to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.. Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.. We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpiration of, or detrimental changes in, research and development tax credit laws;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax effects of equity - based compensation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts related to intercompany restructurings; or.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.. 58. Table of Contents. In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.. If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), as a result of our ownership of CWGS, LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \"investment company\" for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \"investment company,\" as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.. As the sole managing member of CWGS, LLC, we control and operate CWGS, LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in CWGS, LLC is not an \"investment security\" as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of CWGS, LLC, our interest in CWGS, LLC could be deemed an \"investment security\" for purposes of the 1940 Act.. We and CWGS, LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. that do not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as it benefits the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P.. Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. that do not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it benefits such Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. In connection with our IPO, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with CWGS, LLC and such Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. and it provides for the payment by Camping World Holdings, Inc. to the Continuing Equity Owners and Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that Camping World Holdings, Inc. actually realizes, or in some circumstances is deemed to realize, as a result of (i) increases in tax basis resulting from the purchase of common units from Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. in exchange for Class A common stock in connection with the consummation of the IPO and the related corporate reorganization transactions and any future redemptions that are funded by Camping World Holdings, Inc. or exchanges of common units and (ii) certain other tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Although Camping World Holdings, Inc. will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A common stock.. Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock. The Continuing Equity Owners (through common units) own interests in CWGS, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners have the right to redeem their interests in CWGS, LLC pursuant to the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement for newly-issued shares of Class A common stock or cash.. At December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of 213,241,767 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including approximately 51,890,495 shares of Class A common stock issuable, at. 59. Table of Contents. our election, upon redemption of CWGS, LLC common units held by the Continuing Equity Owners. In connection with our IPO, CWGS, LLC entered into the CWGS LLC Agreement, and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein, the Continuing Equity Owners are entitled to have their common units redeemed from time to time at each of their options for, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one - for - one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each common unit redeemed, in each case in accordance with the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such common units. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. In connection with our IPO, we also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued upon such redemption and the shares of Class A common stock issued to the Former Equity Owners in connection with the corporate reorganization transactions entered into in connection therewith will be eligible for resale, subject to certain limitations set forth therein.. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.. You may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock or common units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of our Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. In addition, we, CWGS, LLC and the Continuing Equity Owners are party to the CWGS LLC Agreement under which the Continuing Equity Owners (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right (subject to the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement) to have their common units redeemed from time to time at each of their options by CWGS, LLC in exchange for, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one - for - one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each common unit redeemed, in each case in accordance with the terms of the CWGS LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election (determined solely by our independent directors (within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE) who are disinterested), we may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such common units. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. The market price of shares of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of these redemptions or exchanges or the perception that a redemption could occur. These redemptions or exchanges, or the possibility that these redemptions or exchanges may occur, also might make it more difficult for holders of our Class A common stock to sell such stock in the future at a time and at a price that they deem appropriate.. We have reserved shares for issuance under our 2016 Incentive Award Plan (the \"2016 Plan\") in an amount equal to 14,693,518 shares of Class A common stock, including, as of December 31, 2017, shares of Class A common stock issuable pursuant to 1,132,557 stock options and 1,290,552 restricted stock units that were granted to certain of our directors and certain of our employees. Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2016 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership of holders of our Class A common stock.. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the Original Equity Owners. Any sales in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.. 60. Table of Contents. In the future, we may also issue additional securities if we need to raise capital, including, but not limited to, in connection with acquisitions, which could constitute a material portion of our then - outstanding shares of Class A common stock.. Our Class A common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.. Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section and this Form 10-K, as well as the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour operating and financial performance and prospects;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconditions that impact demand for our services;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors' businesses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe size of our public float;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcoverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in senior management or key personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tissuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our dividend policy;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.. As a result, volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their Class A common stock at or above the price they paid for such shares. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.. 61. Table of Contents. Our ability to pay regular and special dividends on our Class A common stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our structure and statutory restrictions and restrictions imposed by our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility as well as any future agreements.. CWGS, LLC has in the past made a regular quarterly cash distribution to its common unit holders of approximately $0.08 per common unit, and CWGS, LLC intends to continue to make such quarterly cash distributions. We have used in the past, and intend to continue to use, all of the proceeds from such distributions on our common units to declare cash dividends on our Class A common stock.. CWGS, LLC is required to make cash distributions in accordance with the CWGS LLC Agreement in an amount sufficient for us to pay any expenses incurred by us in connection with the regular quarterly cash dividend, along with any of our other operating expenses and other obligations. In addition, we have paid, and currently intend to pay, a special cash dividend of all or a portion of the Excess Tax Distribution to the holders of our Class A common stock from time to time, subject to the discretion of our board of directors. However, the payment of future dividends on our Class A common stock will be subject to our discretion as the sole managing member of CWGS, LLC, the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Our Existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our Floor Plan Facility also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. Additionally, our ability to distribute any Excess Tax Distribution will also be subject to no early termination or amendment of the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as the amount of tax distributions actually paid to us and our actual tax liability. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our Class A common stock. Accordingly, you may have to sell some or all of your Class A common stock after price appreciation in order to generate cash flow from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell your Class A common stock and you may lose the entire amount of the investment. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. For additional information on our payments of dividends, see \"Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy\" under Part II of this Form 10-K.. Delaware law and certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our company.. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti - takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour board of directors is classified into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three - year term;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta majority of our stockholders or a majority of our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders, and at such time as the ML Related Parties, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the aggregate, less than 27.5% of all of the outstanding common units of CWGS, LLC, only the chairperson of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe have authorized undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at an annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of our outstanding shares of common stock. 62.

These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.. Please see \" -  Risks Relating to Our Organizational Structure  -  Marcus Lemonis, through his beneficial ownership of our shares directly or indirectly held by ML Acquisition and ML RV Group, has substantial control over us, including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and his interests, along with the interests of our other Continuing Equity Owners, in our business may conflict with yours.\". Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock are deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may. 63. Table of Contents. limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our board of directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.. The obligations associated with being a public company have required, and will continue to require, significant resources and management attention, which may divert from our business operations.. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") and the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \"Sarbanes - Oxley Act\"). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes - Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur prior to our IPO.. Furthermore, as a public company, we will continue to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that have not been reflected in our historical financial statements for periods prior to the IPO included in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted, and will need to continue to devote, a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. These rules and regulations result in our incurring legal and financial compliance costs and have made, and will continue to make, some activities more time - consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.. Recently identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.. As a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and NYSE. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we have, and periodically evaluate, procedures with respect to our internal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to continue to place a considerable strain on our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as on our personnel.. In addition, as a public company we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which requires us to document and make. 64. Table of Contents. significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements and the audit of our financial results for 2017, material weaknesses in our internal controls relating to (i) insufficient analysis to correctly determine the portion of the deferred tax asset resulting from our direct investment in CWGS, LLC not expected to be realized, (ii) the insufficient documentation and/or execution of certain accounting policies and procedures within FreedomRoads, which operates the RV dealerships, and (iii) ineffective transaction level and management review controls over the valuation of trade-in unit inventory were identified. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 was not effective. These material weaknesses have caused us to restate our previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2017, three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2017. As described in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K, management is taking steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls. There can be no assurance that any measures we take will remediate the material weaknesses identified, nor can there be any assurance as to how quickly we will be able to remediate these material weaknesses.. In future periods, if our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on management's assessment and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified, we may be required to again restate our financial statements and could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, a loss of public and investor confidence, and to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our Class A common stock.. Furthermore, the correction of any such material weaknesses, including the ones noted above, could require additional remedial measures including additional personnel which could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the NYSE or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.. The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about our company and our industry. If one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our Class A common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline."
