[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. In addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. Risks Relating to our Substantial Indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments to EPR, could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $466 million of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding, including $450 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term B Loan of the Term Loan Facility (with an additional borrowing capacity of $70 million under the Term A Loan of the Term Loan Facility), $16 of borrowings outstanding under the Bangkok Bank Loan (with an additional borrowing capacity of $4 million), no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (with borrowing capacity of $15 million, of which $9 million was drawn on January 23, 2018 and $4 million was drawn on February 12, 2018) and $20 million of borrowing capacity under the Kien Huat Backstop Loan (which capacity can be used solely to repay the Bangkok Bank Loan). Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our principal debt agreements, which are referenced above, or to our future borrowings, would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent Montreign Operating is unable to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into Montreign Operating would be limited by the covenants in the Bangkok Bank Loan and our business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.. In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:. • increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;. • limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;. • making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or. • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.. Moreover, the Entertainment Village and Golf Course will continue to be capital intensive. To the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and cash generated by our operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. These projects may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures.. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate we could experience decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations. We cannot provide assurance that future borrowings will be available to us under our Term Loan Facility, Revolving Credit Facility or Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us.. The agreements governing our Term Loan Facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.. Covenants governing our Term Loan Facility and certain of our other indebtedness restrict, among other things, our ability to:. 10. • pay dividends or distributions, including from subsidiaries to Empire, repurchase or issue equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;. • incur additional debt, including  limiting our ability to borrow further capital needed to complete the Development Projects, if needed;. • direct a significant portion of our available cash to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our use of available cash to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;. • incur liens on assets; and. • sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets.. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.  In addition, the Term Loan Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Any default under the Term Loan Facility or the other principal debt agreements could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt. The ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend on the future performance of the Casino, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to service such debt, we may be required, among other things, to:. • seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;. • delay, curtail or abandon altogether our development plans;. • refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or. • sell selected assets.. Such measures might be insufficient to service the indebtedness. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If funds are not available when needed, or available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our obligations with respect to the Development Projects. In addition, we may not be able to grow market share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.. Defaults under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement or the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement could result in a substantial loss of our assets.. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement. A failure to repay any of this indebtedness as it becomes due or to otherwise comply with the covenants contained in any of our principal debt agreements could result in an event of default thereunder.  If  not cured or waived, an event of default under any of our principal debt agreements could enable the lenders thereunder to declare all borrowings outstanding on such debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. The lenders could also elect to foreclose on our assets securing such debt. Such actions by the lenders could cause cross defaults pursuant to the terms of our principal debt agreements. In such an event, the Company may not be able to refinance or repay all of its indebtedness, pay dividends or have sufficient liquidity to meet operating and capital expenditure requirements. Any such acceleration could cause us to lose a substantial portion of our assets and will substantially adversely affect our ability to continue our operations.. A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.. In connection with the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, Montreign Operating was required to obtain credit ratings for its debt offering.  Although the maintenance of a certain credit rating is not a condition to the availability of the Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility, an adverse change in this credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could adversely affect our business. Such ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action.  For example, such ratings could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition.. If any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a \"watch list\" for a possible downgrade or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding in the future, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, among other obligations.. 11. Risks Relating to our Business. The gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive, with many of our competitors better known and better financed than us.. We primarily compete directly with other casino and VGM facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas.  The gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive and increasingly dominated by multinational corporations or Native American tribes that enjoy widespread name recognition, established brand loyalty, decades of casino operation experience, an array of amenities, high-quality management talent and a diverse portfolio of gaming assets and with substantially greater financial resources.. In a broader sense, our gaming operations face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities, including: shopping; athletic events; television and movies; concerts; and travel.  If our competitors operate more successfully than we do, if they attract patrons away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion, if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees, if their properties are enhanced or expanded, if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business, we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our patrons could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We expect that competition from internet gaming will continue to grow and intensify.. We expect that we will face increased competition from internet gaming as the potential for legalized internet gaming continues to grow. Several states are currently considering legislation that would legalize internet gaming at the state level. As a result of the Justice Department's December 2011 opinion concerning the applicability of the Wire Act to internet gaming, certain states including Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted legislation to authorize various forms of intrastate internet gaming. Notably, in February 2013, Nevada amended its internet gaming law to permit Nevada-licensed internet providers to commence internet poker and to allow the state to enter into agreements with other states to create multi-state on-line poker wagering, and in November 2013, New Jersey authorized intrastate internet gaming through Atlantic City casinos. The New Jersey law provides that licensed Atlantic City casinos may offer internet gambling games subject to regulations of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (the \"NJDGE\"). The law provides for a 15% tax on internet gaming gross revenues and permits New Jersey to enter into agreements with other states to engage in multi-state internet wagering pools. The law has a 10-year sunset provision. A number of New Jersey casinos participate in intrastate internet gaming. Our ability to compete in a marketplace containing multiple virtual casino platforms will depend on our ability to effectively market our gaming products to our patrons in the face of stiff competition as well as the availability of internet gaming in jurisdictions in which we operate casinos. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their patrons to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert patrons from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. There have also been proposals that would specifically legalize internet gaming under federal law.. New York State could grant additional Gaming Facility Licenses in our area or in New York City or the surrounding counties earlier than the expected seven-year blackout period, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.. The Gaming Act provides for the award of up to four Gaming Facility Licenses in three regions of upstate New York, including our area, and prohibits the issuance of Gaming Facility Licenses in the \"downstate\" region, which includes New York City and its surrounding counties. The award of such a Gaming Facility License is intended to be exclusive for a period of seven years commencing on the date of our award of the Gaming Facility License, which occurred in December 2015. We can provide no assurance that the New York State government will not change this law and issue additional Gaming Facility Licenses before the expiration of this seven-year exclusivity period. If the New York State government were to allow additional competitors to operate in our area or in other regions of New York through the grant of additional Gaming Facility Licenses, we would face additional competition, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.. Our inability or the inability of our subsidiaries, key personnel, significant stockholders, vendors financial sources or joint venture partners to obtain or maintain required gaming regulatory licenses, permits or approvals could prevent us from operating our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.. 12. Gaming is a highly regulated industry that is subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances that are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, some of the licenses that we and our subsidiaries, officers, directors, principal stockholders, financial sources and vendors hold expire after a relatively short period of time and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these licenses in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the regulatory agencies. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to continually renew all registrations, permits, approvals or licenses necessary to conduct our operations in the state of New York as intended. If we or our subsidiaries, financial sources or vendors do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we or such individuals or entities, may be required to divest any interest in our current or future gaming facilities or our current gaming facilities risk losing their licenses. These laws, regulations and ordinances may also affect the operations of our gaming facilities or our plans in pursuing future projects.  Any adverse developments in the regulation of the gaming industry in New York State could be difficult to comply with and could significantly increase our costs, which could cause our operations to be unsuccessful.. Changes in the laws, regulations, and ordinances (including local laws) to which our gaming operations are subject, and the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to our operations, may adversely affect our results of operation.. Casino gaming is still a relatively new industry in New York and many of the rules and regulations governing casino gaming are still evolving and subject to interpretation.  Under the Gaming Act, the NYSGC has extensive authority to regulate gaming activities.  The NYSGC also has the authority to interpret the Gaming Act, which has far-reaching effect on our business decisions.  For example, the NYSGC decides whether a gaming option available at the Casino constitutes a slot machine or table game and that decision impacts the choices we make on laying out the gaming floor.  Certain provisions of the gaming regulations that have significant impact on our operations, such as the allowance for free play, are promulgated by the NYSGC and not established by the Gaming Act.  The NYSGC has further discretion to deviate from the established free play allowance and to revoke such deviation at any time.   Moreover, lack of visibility into the applicability of, and the expense related to complying with, specific licensing requirements and background investigations means we are unable to pass on these costs to vendors and employees and thereby reduce our costs of operation.  The uncertainty surrounding the evolving interpretations of the Gaming Act and the regulations promulgated by the NYSGC may hinder our ability to negotiate agreements with third parties, such as a vendor or a junket enterprise, and establish policies relating to our workforce because we are unable to effectively judge the relative costs and benefits of these relationships.  These new or changing regulations and interpretations of the Gaming Act, as well as  the uncertainty of the NYSGC's further actions with respect to such regulations and interpretations could adversely affect our results of operations.. Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer and corporate spending as a result of global economic conditions.. Consumer demand for resort casinos, trade shows and conventions and for the type of luxury amenities that we offer is particularly sensitive to changes in the global economy, which adversely impact discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general global economic conditions, high unemployment, weakness in housing or oil markets, perceived or actual changes in disposable consumer income and wealth, an economic recession and changes in consumer confidence in the global economy, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism have in the past and could in the future reduce patron demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities we offer, and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results.. The loss or a reduction in the play of our most significant patrons could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A downturn in economic conditions in the countries in which these patrons reside could cause a reduction in the frequency of visits by and revenue generated from these patrons.. Also, consumer demographics and preferences may evolve over time, which, for example, has resulted in growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and react to those trends and any failure to do so may negatively impact our operating results.. 13. We are subject to greater risks than a geographically diverse company.. Our operations are limited to the Catskills region of New York State, which has been affected by a decades-long decline in economic conditions.  We expect that a majority of the patrons for our Casino will come from the New York metropolitan area.  As a result, in addition to our susceptibility to adverse global and domestic economic, political and business conditions, any economic downturn in the Catskill region or the New York metropolitan area could have a material adverse effect on our operations. An economic downturn would likely cause a decline in the disposable income of consumers, which could result in a decrease in the number of patrons at our facilities, the frequency of their visits and the average amount that they would be willing to spend at our facilities. We are subject to greater risks than more geographically diversified gaming or resort operations, including:. • a downturn in national, regional or local economic conditions;. • an increase in competition in New York State or the northeastern United States and Canada, particularly for day-trip           patrons residing in the New York metropolitan area, including as a result of other gaming and entertainment operations in  New York State, Connecticut, New Jersey and Pennsylvania;. • impeded access due to road construction or closures of primary access routes; and. • adverse weather and natural and other disasters in the northeastern United States.. The occurrence of any one of the events described above could cause a material disruption in our business and make us unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our obligations.. We are required to pay a portion of our cash flows as fixed and percentage rent under the Casino Lease and as a fee under the RWS License Agreement, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.. From March through August 2018, Montreign Operating is required to make monthly fixed rent payments of $1 million under the lease of the parcel on which the Casino was constructed (the \"Casino Lease\").  Beginning in September 2018, Montreign Operating is required to make annual rent payments of $7.5 million under the Casino Lease, subject to an 8% escalation every five years. In addition to fixed rent, beginning in September 2018 and through the remainder of the term of the Casino Lease, Montreign Operating is obligated to pay an annual percentage rent equal to five percent of the Eligible Gaming Revenue (as such term is defined in the Casino Lease) in excess of  the base rent.  Furthermore, beginning on the date on which the Casino opened to the public, Montreign Operating is required to pay RWS a fee equivalent to a percentage of Net Revenue (as such term is defined in the RWS License Agreement) generated in each calendar year for its use of the RWS Licensed Marks.  The percentage of Net Revenue payable as the fee is a low single digit percentage that will increase incrementally between the third year and sixth year of the term of the RWS License Agreement and will remain a low single digit percentage during the entire term of the RWS License Agreement.  As a result, our ability to fund our own operations, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the Casino Lease and RWS Agreement may:. • make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;. • increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;. • require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects and other general corporate purposes;. • limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;. • restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and. • cause us to lose our rights with respect to the property leased under the Casino Lease or the RWS Licensed Marks if we default on the Casino Lease or the RWS License Agreement, respectively.. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We depend on our skilled employees and key personnel and the loss of their services would adversely affect our operations and business strategy.. The operation of our businesses requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming, hospitality and horse racing industry experience and qualifications to enable such individuals to obtain and maintain the requisite licenses and approvals from the NYSGC. We also place substantial reliance on the gaming, project development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the northeastern United States gaming market possessed by members of our senior management team. If we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new skilled employees with high levels of expertise in the gaming areas in which we engage and propose to engage, or are unable to do so without unreasonably increasing our labor costs, the. 14. execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the continued employment of our executive management and the hiring of strategic personnel at reasonable costs. Competition for skilled employees and qualified executives is intense and we can give no assurance that we would be able to hire a qualified replacement with the required level of experience and expertise for any current members of our senior management, if required to do so. Accordingly, if any of our current key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, or we were unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, recruiting and hiring a replacement for any skilled employees or executive management position could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses.. Work stoppages, labor problems and unexpected shutdowns may limit our operational flexibility and negatively impact our future profits.. We are party to four collective bargaining agreements with different unions at our Monticello Casino and Raceway property.  We will begin negotiations with a negotiating unit for a collective bargaining agreement for certain employee groups at Resorts World Catskills. Further, we expect that additional agreements may be added in the future for Resorts World Catskills. The addition of new or changes to the existing collective bargaining agreements could cause significant increases in labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, the unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements or other unions could seek to organize groups of employees at our properties that are not currently represented by unions. Union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our businesses and result in significant costs. Any unexpected shutdown of our properties from a work stoppage or strike action could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Moreover, strikes, work stoppages or other job actions could also result in adverse media attention or otherwise discourage patrons, including convention and meeting groups, from visiting our properties. We cannot assure that we can be adequately prepared for labor developments that may lead to a temporary or permanent shutdown of any of our properties.. We often extend credit, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit players or credit play may decrease.. We conduct our gaming activities on a credit as well as a cash basis. The casino credit we extend is generally unsecured and due on demand. We will extend casino credit to those patrons whose level of play and financial resources, in the opinion of management, warrant such an extension. The collectability of receivables from international patrons could be negatively affected by future business or economic trends or by significant events in the countries in which these patrons reside.. While gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \"marker,\" are enforceable under the current laws of New York, and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states of the United States under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that direct or indirect enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the United States of foreign debtors may be used to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations. We cannot assure that we will be able to collect the full amount of gaming debts owed to us, even in jurisdictions that enforce them. Changes in economic conditions may make it more difficult to assess creditworthiness and more difficult to collect the full amount of any gaming debt owed to us. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.. We face the risk of fraud and cheating.. Our gaming patrons may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Win rates for our gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.. The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets played, the amount of time played and undiscovered acts of fraud or cheating. Our gross gaming revenues are mainly derived from the difference between our casino winnings and the casino winnings of our gaming patrons.. 15. Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, we do not have full control over our winnings or the winnings of our gaming patrons.. In addition, premium gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.. Our table games business is subject to volatility which could adversely affect our financial condition.. Table gaming, especially high-end table gaming, is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in table games hold percentage may have a positive or negative impact on our quarterly revenues and operating results. Negative variations in quarterly revenues and operating results could adversely affect our financial condition.. Our business could be affected by weather-related factors.. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by weather-related factors, such as hurricanes and blizzards and other unfavorable winter weather conditions. Such weather conditions may discourage potential patrons from traveling or may deter or prevent patrons from reaching our facilities. If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and ability to meet our financial obligations.. Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.. We are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our patrons may result in reduced visitation to Resorts World Catskills and Monticello Casino and Raceway and a reduction in our revenues.. Negative conditions affecting the lodging industry may have an adverse effect on our revenues and cash flows.. We depend on revenues generated from our hotel, together with revenues generated from other portions of the facilities, to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations. Revenues generated from our hotel are primarily subject to conditions affecting our gaming operations, but are also subject to the lodging industry in general, and as a result, our financial performance and cash flows may be affected not only by the conditions in the gaming industry, but also by those in the lodging industry. Some of these conditions are as follows:. •  changes in the local, regional or national economic climate, including economic recessions;. •  changes in local conditions such as the supply of hotel properties;. •  decreases in the level of demand for hotel rooms and related services;. •  the attractiveness of our hotel to patrons;. •  cyclical over-building in the hotel industry;. •  changes in travel patterns;. •  public health concerns affecting public accommodations or travel generally or regionally; and. •  changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors.. Casinos are subject to Anti-Money Laundering Laws.. We deal with significant amounts of cash in the operations and will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. We cooperate with all such inquiries. Any violation of AML laws or regulations, on which in recent years governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, performance, prospects, value, financial condition and results of operations.. We have implemented internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices.  However, such policies, procedures and programs may not be effective in prohibiting our directors, employees, vendors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our directors, employees, vendors or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.. 16. Instability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our ability to raise additional capital to expand our businesses.. We may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to finance our plans for growth. Instability and volatility in the financial markets caused by general economic conditions or otherwise may impede our ability to raise capital in the public or private credit or equity markets to fund our business strategy on terms we believe to be reasonable, if at all. Meanwhile, existing indebtedness, such as the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur debt at all. Moreover, we may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. An inability to obtain the capital we need to finance our growth plans may adversely effect our operations and business prospects.. We may be subject to environmental liability as a result of unknown environmental hazards.. We are subject to various federal, New York State and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations and the construction of the Development Projects, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in regulatory fines, legal fees and costs for remediation. Such fines and costs could be related to our storage, handling and disposal of waste from our racing operations, the existence of asbestos at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the existence of environmental conditions at the site of the Development Projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.. Our information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of patron information or other breaches of information security.. We rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit patrons' personal and/or financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our patrons' personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security.. Risks Relating to the Development Projects. Construction at the Development Projects, which is still ongoing, is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.. The construction of large-scale properties such as the Development Projects can be dangerous. Construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting the contractor and us to liabilities, possible losses, delays in completion of the projects and negative publicity. In the event of such accidents, we may stop construction for several days to allow for safety inspections and investigations. We and our contractors will take safety precautions that are consistent with industry practice, but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injuries or further loss of life, damage to property or delays. If accidents occur during the construction of Development Projects, we may be subject to delays, including delays imposed by regulators, liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance, and our business, prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.. The costs associated with the Casino and the Development Projects may increase due to risks inherent in the design and development of such projects and their construction.. The construction of the Development Projects subjects us to significant risks inherent in the construction of a new facility, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory and environmental problems. The Development Projects could also experience:. • changes to plans and specifications (some of which may require the approval of the NYSGC), even after the opening of such facilities;. 17. • delays and significant cost increases;. • shortages of materials;. • shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;. • inability of contractors and subcontractors to obtain and maintain required licenses issued by the NYSGC;. • inability to meet MWBE participation goals;. • labor disputes or work stoppages;. • disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;. • health and safety incidents and site accidents;. • engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;. • poor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;. • changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming;. • unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;. • environmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;. • weather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses;. • other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases; and. • failure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals with respect to the Entertainment Project and Golf Course Project.. The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of the Development Projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of the Development Projects, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to require additional external financing.. The Casino has limited operating history and the Entertainment Project and the Golf Course have no operating history. Our expectations for the operations of such properties may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results and prospects.. There is no historical information available about the Entertainment Project or the Golf Course Project upon which you can base your evaluation of their respective business plans and prospects. The Casino has recently begun to generate revenue and the Entertainment Project and Golf Project will begin generating revenue when they are open to the public. As a result, you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as a company seeking to develop and operate a major new development project and gaming businesses in a rapidly growing and intensely competitive market.. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies developing a major new project, and those risks and difficulties may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as the gaming market in the northeastern United States. Some of the risks relate to our ability to:. • complete our construction projects within their anticipated time schedules and budgets;. • attract and retain patrons and qualified employees;. • operate, support, expand and develop our operations and our facilities;. • maintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses;. • develop and maintain internal personnel, systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming business;. • respond to changes in our regulatory environment; and. • respond to competitive market conditions.. If we are unable to complete any of these tasks, we may be unable to complete and operate the Development Projects in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues in the amounts and by the times we anticipate. We may also be unable to meet the conditions to draw on the Term A Loan in order to fund our development and construction activities. If any of these events were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. Even if the Casino, the Entertainment Project and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned and opened, they may not be financially successful, which would limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to repay our debt.. Even if the Casino, the Entertainment Project and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned, one or more still may not be a financially successful venture or generate the cash flows that we anticipate. We cannot assure that the level of consumer demand for the Casino or for the type of luxury amenities that we will offer will meet our expectations, and we may not attract the level of patronage that we are seeking. If the Casino, the Entertainment Project or the Golf Course Project do not attract. 18. sufficient business, this will limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service payments under our debt agreements. Additionally, the demands imposed by new developments on our managerial, operational and other resources may impact our operation of our existing Monticello Casino and Raceay facility.  If any of these issues were to occur, it could adversely affect our prospects, financial condition, or results of operations.. Our business depends on a strong brand and if we are not able to build, maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our market will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.. On March 31, 2017, we entered into the RWS License Agreement, pursuant to which RWS granted to Montreign Operating the non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited to right to use certain \"Genting\" and \"Resorts World\" trademarks. Building, maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive.. We consider the Resorts World brand name under which we market our facility, property and services to be important to our business since it has the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract patrons to our facilities. We anticipate the possibility that income generated from high-end gaming patrons can cause variability in our results.. Risks Relating to our Ownership Structure. Stockholders' ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because our major stockholder owns a large percentage of our common stock.. Kien Huat is the beneficial holder of 28,914,606 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 88.0% of our voting power as of March 15, 2018. Under the terms of an investment agreement dated November 12, 2009 (the \"Investment Agreement\"), between the Company and Kien Huat, if any option or warrant outstanding as of the final closing under the Investment Agreement, or the first 200,000 shares granted to directors or officers who served in such capacity as of the final closing date under the Investment Agreement, are exercised, Kien Huat has the right (following notice of such exercise) to purchase an equal number of additional shares of our common stock as are issued upon such exercise at the exercise price for the applicable option or warrant (such rights the \"Option Matching Rights\"). As of December 31, 2017, Kien Huat had approximately 3,000 Option Matching Rights.. Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, Kien Huat is also entitled to recommend three directors candidates whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board of Directors (\"Board\"), subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board. Kien Huat will continue to be entitled to recommend three directors candidates for so long as it owns at least 24% of our voting power outstanding at such time, after which the number of directors whom Kien Huat will be entitled to designate for election to our Board will be reduced proportionally to Kien Huat's percentage of ownership. Under the Investment Agreement, for so long as Kien Huat is entitled to recommend nominees to serve as Board members, among other things, Kien Huat will have the right to nominate one of its director designees to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Emanuel Pearlman has been appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board pursuant to Kien Huat's recommendation. Until such time as Kien Huat ceases to own capital stock with at least 30% of our voting power outstanding at such time, our Board will be prohibited under the terms of the Investment Agreement from taking certain actions relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters without the affirmative vote of the directors recommended by Kien Huat and elected by shareholders. Consequently, Kien Huat has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of our Board and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as approving amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets, as well as other matters. Although Kien Huat has expressed no interest in doing so, Kien Huat is not restricted from acquiring additional shares of our common stock, including through open market purchases. However, on February 17, 2016,and as amended on December 28, 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Kien Huat (the \"Kien Huat Letter Agreement\"), wherein Kien Huat agreed, for a period of four years from the date of the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, to seek certain approvals of the Board of Directors and minority shareholders in connection with any \"going-private\" transaction. Notwithstanding the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, this concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other stockholders may desire or force the sale of our company on terms undesirable to other stockholders.. 19. Risks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock. The Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. If the NYSGC believes a stockholder does not meet their subjective determination, a stockholder may be forced to sell any stock they hold and such sale may result in a material loss of investment value for the stockholder.. The Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. A failure to possess such qualifications could lead to a material loss of investment by either us or our stockholders, as it would require divestiture of the stockholder's direct or indirect interest in us. Consequently, should any stockholder ever fail to meet the qualifications necessary to own a direct or indirect interest in us as determined by NYSGC, such stockholder could be forced to liquidate all interests in us. Should such stockholder be forced to liquidate these interests within a relatively short period of time, such stockholder would likely be forced to sell at a discount, causing a material loss of investment value.. The market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.. The market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, between January 1, 2017 and March 10, 2018, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $15.49 and $30.98 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including, but not necessarily limited to the following:. • quarter-to-quarter variations in operating results;. • day traders;. • adverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and. • market conditions for the gaming industry.. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.. If we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.. Our common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of our common stock could decline.. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.. During the past three fiscal years, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. There can be no assurance that we will have, at any time, sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends.. Future sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline.. A portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers and a significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by Kien Huat, our largest stockholder. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a prearranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may adversely impact the market price of our stock.. 20. Future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Commitment Letter or the effective shelf registration statement, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur could affect the market price of our common stock. Kien Huat's stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.. Risks Relating to our Racing Operations. The continuing decline in the popularity of horse racing, decline of the horse population and increasing competition in simulcasting could adversely impact the business of Monticello Casino and Raceway.. Since the mid-1980s, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering at live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other forms of gaming, unwillingness of guests to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off-track wagering. The declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets. The industry-wide focus on inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately $2.9 million,  $2.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of revenues from the import and export simulcasting of out-of-state racing, of which approximately $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were due to the horsemen. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, continued decline in the horse population and available drivers, as well as increased competition in the inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets, could lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at Monticello Casino and Raceway. Our business plan anticipates the possibility of Monticello Casino and Raceway attracting new guests to our racetrack wagering operations through VGMs in order to offset the general decline in raceway attendance. However, even if our VGM operations attract new guests to our racetrack, we may not be able to generate profit from operations. Public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change. Any further decline in interest in horse racing or any change in public tastes may adversely affect our revenues and, therefore, limit our ability to make a positive contribution to our results of operation."
