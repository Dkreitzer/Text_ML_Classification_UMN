[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors.. Our business faces many risks. Past experience may not be indicative of future performance, and as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have included forward-looking statements about our business, plans and prospects that are subject to change. Forward-looking statements are particularly located in, but not limited to, the sections “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In addition to the other risks or uncertainties contained in this report, the risks described below may affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If any of these risks occur, either alone or in combination with other factors, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Moreover, readers should note this is not an exhaustive list of the risks we face; some risks are unknown or not quantifiable, and other risks that we currently perceive as immaterial may ultimately prove more significant than expected. Statements about plans, predictions or expectations should not be construed to be assurances of performance or promises to take a given course of action.. Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital. Based on our lack of sufficient revenue since inception and recurring losses from operations, our independent registered public accounting firm may include, from time to time, an explanatory paragraph in their opinion as to the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.. Since our spin-off from Integrated BioPharma, Inc. in August 2008, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. As of June 30, 2018, the Company's accumulated deficit was $88.2 million. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, the Company's net loss was approximately $16.1 million and it had cash used in operating activities of $13.5 million. As of June 30, 2018, cash on hand totaled approximately $15.9 million which is expected to support the Company's activities at least through September 30, 2019.. On June 26, 2018, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering with total gross proceeds of approximately $16,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The securities offered by the Company consisted of (i) 4,350,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share, (ii) 6,300 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1,000 per preferred share, and convertible into an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share, (iii) 5,785 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1,000 per preferred share, and convertible into an aggregate of 6,427,778 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share. The Company granted the underwriters, Alliance Global Partners, a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,666,666 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. On July 12, 2018, the Company received approximately $1,350,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company, from the proceeds of the sale of 1,500,000 over-allotment shares of Common Stock purchased at $0.90 by the underwriter during the 45-day provision.. 13. In the past, the history of significant losses, the negative cash flow from operations, the limited cash resources on hand and the dependence by the Company on its ability – about which there can be no certainty – to obtain additional financing to fund its operations after the current cash resources are exhausted had raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. We believe the total gross proceeds from the June 26, 2018, public offering and related over allotment totaling $17,350,000 described above, in conjunction with the generation of revenue from the implementation of our new business plan, will provide the Company with adequate cash on hand to support the Company's activities at least through the next twelve months. As such, these financial statements were prepared under the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.. We have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses during our next fiscal year and may never achieve or maintain profitability.. Since our 2008 spinoff from Integrated BioPharma, Inc., we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. Our net loss was approximately $16.1 million for each of the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. As of June 30, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $88.2 million.. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of common stock and warrants. We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including the development and validation of our technologies, our CDMO facilities, and the development of a proprietary therapeutic product against fibrosis based upon our technologies. We have not completed development of or commercialized any vaccine or therapeutic product candidates. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may incur operating losses for at least the next year. We anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase substantially if we:. ·     initiate clinical trials of our product candidates;. ·     continue the research and development of our product candidates;. ·     seek to discover additional product candidates; and. ·     add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and manufacturing efforts.. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in attracting and maintaining customers for the development, manufacturing and technology transfer services offered by our subsidiary iBio CDMO. Our profitability depends on the spending on iBio CDMO’s services by its customers and potential customers. In addition, our profitability will also depend on continuing to commercialize our technologies or we, alone or with our licensees, must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us, alone or with our licensees and collaborators, to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which regulatory approval is obtained or establishing collaborations with parties willing and able to provide necessary capital or other value. We may never succeed in these activities. We may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability.. 14. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would diminish the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.. We may need additional funding to execute our business plan, which funding may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate the commercialization of our development and manufacturing services and efforts or our product development programs.. We have limited financial resources and may need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations, especially if we are delayed or are unsuccessful in attracting and maintaining customers for the development, manufacturing and technology transfer services offered by our subsidiary iBio CDMO. To the extent that we initiate or continue clinical development without securing collaborator or licensee funding, our research and development expenses could increase substantially. Additionally, to the extent that our efforts to out-license our technologies and product candidates are unsuccessful or we find that it is necessary to advance the development of product candidates further than contemplated by our current business plans to secure favorable licensing terms, we would require substantial additional capital.. On May 15, 2015, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC (“Aspire Capital”) pursuant to which we had the option to require Aspire Capital to purchase up to $15 million of common stock over a three-year term. No shares were sold under the 2015 Facility and the agreement with Aspire was terminated on July 21, 2017.. On July 24, 2017, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”), an Illinois limited liability company, pursuant to which Lincoln Park agreed to purchase from us up to an aggregate of $16,000,000 of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over the 36-month term of the agreement (the “Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement” or “Purchase Agreement”). As a result, on July 24, 2017, 120,000 shares of our common stock were issued to Lincoln Park as consideration for Lincoln Park’s commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the agreement, and 250,000 shares of common stock were sold to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase for an aggregate gross purchase price of $1,000,000. During March 2018, the Company sold an additional 60,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park for an aggregate gross purchase price of $121,290.. As of June 30, 2018, under the terms and subject to the conditions of the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to, an additional $14,878,710 worth of shares of the Company's common stock. Such future sales of common stock by the Company, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at the Company's option, over the 36-month term of the agreement. The agreement with Lincoln Park is more fully described under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, on July 24, 2017, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park (“Registration Rights Agreement”) subsequent to which we filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-1 to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, the shares of common stock that have been or may be issued to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.. The extent to which we utilize the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock, the volume of trading in our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure funds from other sources. The number of shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement on any given day and during the term of the agreement is limited. Additionally, we and Lincoln Park may not effect any sales of shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement during the continuance of an event of default under the Purchase Agreement. Even if we are able to access the full $16.0 million under the Purchase Agreement, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.. When we elect to raise additional funds or additional funds are required, we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives, as well as through sales of common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. Additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization efforts and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.. We expect our existing cash on hand as of June 30, 2018 in the amount of $15.9 million to be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through September 30, 2019. Based on our projections, we expect to obtain additional funds and increase our cash balance through the development and realization of future sales and revenues and funds available pursuant to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement or other funding arrangements. We have based this projection on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, in which case we may deplete our cash resources sooner than we currently anticipate. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:. ·     further obtaining and retention of developmental, manufacturing and facility build-out and technology transfer opportunities at the CDMO;                   ·     the ability to generate and increase third-party client sales and realized revenue at iBio CDMO;. ·     our ability to attract additional licensees or other third parties willing to fund development, and, if successful, commercialization of product candidates;                   ·     the costs, timing and regulatory review of our own product candidates;. ·     the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and. ·     the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies.. 15. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional capital or other alternative financing, we might have to defer or abandon our efforts to commercialize our intellectual property and decrease or even cease operations.. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.. Until such time as we can generate substantial development, manufacturing, license or product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, collaborations, strategic alliances, service contracts, manufacturing contracts, facility build-out and technology transfer contracts, licensing and other arrangements. Sources of funds may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us.. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations.. To the extent that we raise additional capital through a public or private offering and sale of equity securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected and we may be unable to continue our operations.. We have a limited operating history, which may limit the ability of investors to make an informed investment decision.. We commenced independent operations in 2008, and our operations to date have included organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our proprietary technologies, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking, through third parties, preclinical trials and clinical trials of product candidates derived from our technologies. Certain iBioLaunch\231-derived vaccine candidates have been evaluated in completed or ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials; however, all our other vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Neither we nor our collaborators have completed any other clinical trials for any vaccine or therapeutic protein product candidate produced using iBio technology. As a result, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any Phase 2 or pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any conclusion you reach about our future success or viability may not be as predictive as it might be if we had a longer operating history.. We may require additional financing to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to continue operations.. As of June 30, 2018, our accumulated deficit was approximately $88.2 million. We expect our existing cash on hand as of June 30, 2018 in the amount of $15.9 million to be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through September 30, 2019. Based on our projections, we expect to obtain additional funds and increase our cash balance through the development and realization of future sales and revenues and funds available pursuant to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement or other funding arrangements. We have based this projection on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, in which case we may deplete our cash resources sooner than we currently anticipate.. We sold 250,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase under the Purchase Agreement on July 24, 2017, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $1,000,000. During March 2018, the Company sold an additional 60,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park for an aggregate gross purchase price of $121,290. We may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to an additional $14,878,710 worth of shares of our common stock (excluding the initial purchase) under our agreement over a 36-month period generally in amounts up to 10,000 shares of our common stock, which may be increased to up to 60,000 shares of our common stock depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of sale and subject to a maximum limit of $1,000,000 per purchase, on any such business day.. The extent we rely on Lincoln Park as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including, the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources. If obtaining sufficient funding from Lincoln Park were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive, we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Even if we sell all $16,000,000 under the Purchase Agreement to Lincoln Park, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans. Should the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.. Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Technologies and Product Candidates. We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular technology or product candidate and fail to capitalize on technologies or product candidates that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific product candidates derived from or enhanced by our technologies or that have been identified and partially developed by our clients or collaborators. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other technologies or product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending and the spending of our clients and collaborators may not yield any commercially viable products.. 16. We have based our research and development efforts on our technologies and product candidates derived from such technologies. Notwithstanding our large investment to date and anticipated future expenditures in these technologies, we have not yet developed, and may never successfully develop, any marketed products using these technologies. As a result of our exclusive use of our own technologies, we may fail to address or develop product candidates based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.. We also may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates using our technologies. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements on terms less favorable to us than possible.. We, our clients and collaborators, are very early in our development efforts. If we or our clients and collaborators are unable to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.. Excepting a limited number of vaccine candidates that have been evaluated in completed Phase 1 clinical trials, all our other vaccine and therapeutic protein product candidates are still in preclinical development. Our ability to generate product sales revenues for our own products, which we do not expect will occur for many years, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:. •     completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials with positive results;. •     receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;. •     obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;. •     making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for commercial manufacturing capabilities;. •     launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;. •     successfully maintaining existing collaborations and entering into new ones throughout the development process as appropriate, from preclinical studies through to commercialization;. •     acceptance of the products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;. •     effectively competing with other products;. •     obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for any products we successfully develop;. •     protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and. •     maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval.. If we or our collaborators do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.. 17. We may not be successful in our efforts to use iBio technologies to build a pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.. While we believe that data we and our collaborators have obtained from preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials of iBio technology-derived and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates has validated these technologies, our technologies have not yet, and may never lead to, approvable or marketable products. Even if we are successful in further validating our technologies and continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development for many possible reasons, including harmful side effects, limited efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that such product candidates are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we and our collaborators do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technologies, we will not obtain product or collaboration revenues in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.. Neither we nor our clients, collaborators or licensees will be able to commercialize product candidates based on our technologies and services if preclinical studies do not produce successful results or clinical trials do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans.. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and has an uncertain outcome. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We and our licensees may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent the commercialization of product candidates based on our iBio technologies, including the following:. ·     Preclinical or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, which may require additional preclinical testing, additional clinical trials or the abandonment of projects that we expect to be promising. For example, promising animal data may be obtained about the anticipated efficacy of a therapeutic protein product candidate and then human tests may not result in such an effect. In addition, unexpected safety concerns may be encountered that would require further testing even if the therapeutic protein product candidate produced an otherwise favorable response in human subjects.. ·     Initial clinical results may not be supported by further or more extensive clinical trials. For example, a licensee may obtain data that suggest a desirable immune response from a vaccine candidate in a small human study, but when tests are conducted on larger numbers of people, the same extent of immune response may not occur. If the immune response generated by a vaccine is too low or occurs in too few treated individuals, then the vaccine will have no commercial value.. ·     Enrollment in our or our licensee’s clinical trials may be slower than projected, resulting in significant delays. The cost of conducting a clinical trial increases as the time required to enroll adequate numbers of human subjects to obtain meaningful results increases. Enrollment in a clinical trial can be a slower-than-anticipated process because of competition from other clinical trials, because the study is not of interest to qualified subjects, or because the stringency of requirements for enrollment limits the number of people who are eligible to participate in the clinical trial.. ·     We or our licensees might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Animal tests do not always adequately predict potential safety risks to human subjects. The risk of any candidate product is unknown until it is tested in human subjects, and if subjects experience adverse events during the clinical trial, the trial may have to be suspended and modified or terminated entirely.. ·     Regulators or institutional review boards may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including safety concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements.. ·     Any regulatory approval ultimately obtained may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product not commercially viable.. ·     The effects of iBio technology-derived or iBio technology-enhanced product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects.. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we or our licensees do and impair our ability to commercialize our technologies and product candidates based on our technologies. Poor clinical trial results or delays may make it impossible to license a product candidate or so reduce its attractiveness to prospective licensees that we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize such a product candidate.. 18. If we, or our clients and collaborators, are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we, or our clients and collaborators, will not be able to commercialize our, or third-party, product candidates or will not be able to do so as soon as anticipated, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.. Our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate. We have not received approval to market any of our product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third parties to assist us in this process. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate’s safety and efficacy. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use.  If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying label may limit the approved use in such a restrictive manner that it is not possible to obtain commercial viability for such product.. The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive and may take many years. If additional clinical trials are required for certain jurisdictions, these trials can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the review and approval of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept a marketing application as deficient or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable.. Although the FDA and other regulatory authorities have approved plant-based therapeutics in the past, consistent with the oversight of all products, the FDA is monitoring whether these plant-based therapeutics pose any health and human safety risks. While they have not issued any regulation to date that is averse to plant-based vaccines or therapeutics, it is possible that the FDA and other regulatory authorities could issue regulations in the future that could adversely affect our product candidates.. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.. Alternative technologies may supersede our technologies or make them noncompetitive, which would harm our ability to generate future revenue.. The manufacture of biologics and the methods of such manufacture are intensely competitive fields. Each of these fields is characterized by extensive research efforts, which result in rapid technological progress that can render existing technologies obsolete or economically noncompetitive. If our competitors succeed in developing more effective technologies or render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, our business will suffer. Many universities, public agencies and established pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies with substantially greater resources than we have are developing and using technologies and are actively engaging in the development of products similar to or competitive with our technologies and products. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in new technologies and improve existing technologies. To make such renewing investment we will need to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to secure such financing, we will not have sufficient resources to continue such investment.. Our competitors may devise methods and processes for protein expression that are faster, more efficient or less costly than that which can be achieved using iBio technologies. There has been and continues to be substantial academic and commercial research effort devoted to the development of such methods and processes. If successful competitive methods are developed, it may undermine the commercial basis for iBio products and our technologies and related services.. Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.. We face the risk of product liability exposure in connection with the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:. 19. •     decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;. •     injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;. •     withdrawal of clinical trial participants;. •     significant costs to defend the related litigation;. •     substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;. •     loss of revenue;. •     reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and. •     the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.. Prior to commencing human clinical trials, we will seek to obtain product liability insurance coverage. Such insurance coverage is expensive and may not be available in coverage amounts we seek or at all. If we obtain such coverage, we may in the future be unable to maintain such coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.. Risks Related to Dependence on Third Parties. Establishing and maintaining collaborations is a key component of our business strategy. If we are unable to establish new collaborations and maintain both new and existing collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.. Our current business plan contemplates that we will in the future derive significant revenues from collaborators and licensees that successfully utilize iBio technologies in connection with the production, development and commercialization of vaccines and therapeutic protein product candidates. Our realization of these revenues and dependence on existing collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, is subject to a number of risks, including the following:. ·     collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;. ·     collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;. ·     collaborators may not pursue development and, if successful, commercialization of product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;. ·     collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;. ·     collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates;. ·     collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products; or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;. 20. ·     collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;. ·     collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;. ·     collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we would potentially lose the right to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;. ·     collaborators may learn about our technology and use this knowledge to compete with us in the future;. ·     results of collaborators’ preclinical or clinical studies could produce results that harm or impair other products using our technology;. ·     there may be conflicts between different collaborators that could negatively affect those collaborations and potentially others; and. ·     the number and type of our collaborations could adversely affect our attractiveness to future collaborators or acquirers.. If our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or if one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop additional product candidates. There can be no assurance that our collaborations will produce positive results or successful products on a timely basis or at all.. We seek to establish and collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of iBio technology-produced and iBio technology-enhanced product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration depends, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. If we fail to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay its development or the development of one or more of our other product candidates, or increase our expenditures and undertake additional development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our product portfolio and our business may be materially and adversely affected.. If third parties on whom we or our licensees will rely for the conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business may suffer.. We do not have the ability to independently conduct the preclinical studies and clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We have not yet contracted with any third parties to conduct clinical trials of product candidates we develop independently of collaborators. We will depend on licensees or on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct the clinical trials of our product candidates. We will rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials but will not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators participating in our clinical trials will not be our employees. However, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates.. If revenue from a third-party customer or client is concentrated in an amount that makes up a significant percentage of our total revenues, we may be adversely impacted by the significant dependence upon that client, including but not limited to, receipt and collections of outstanding amounts, continued operational allocations toward the client and related efficiencies, capacity and opportunity costs.. At this time, we are continually promoting our technologies and CDMO capabilities to further expand and grow our revenue base and business. We will continue to consider any potential revenue and client related concentration risks. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, one client represented a significant percentage, greater than 50%, of our total revenues. Although we expect our revenues to increase significantly and further vary by client over the next twelve months, there are no guarantees we will be correct in our assumptions.. Risks Related to Intellectual Property. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.. 21. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and product candidates, and by maintenance of our trade secrets through proper procedures.. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.. The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.. Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.. Even if our pending or future patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.. We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could adversely affect us and our collaborators.. 22. Third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.. Our commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. While no such litigation has been brought against us and we have not been held by any court to have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights, we cannot guarantee that our technology, products or use of our products do not infringe third-party patents. It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third-party patents or applications. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing, which is referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our products or technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our technologies, our products or the use of our products.. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. PTO and similar bodies in other countries. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing intellectual property rights and intellectual property rights that may be granted in the future.. If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.. Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our limited number of personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.. If we are unable to protect our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.. In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches of our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.. 23. Risks Related to iBio CDMO’s Operations. If iBio CDMO is unable to provide quality and timely offerings to its customers, its business could suffer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.. A failure of quality control systems in iBio CDMO’s facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of products, in both cases, for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt facility production altogether. In addition, failure to meet required quality standards may result in failure to timely deliver products to customers. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before a product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.. A failure by iBio CDMO to attract and maintain customers and any reduction in spending or demand for iBio CDMO’s development, manufacturing and technology transfer services could have a material adverse effect on our business.. iBio CDMO’s operations will depend, in part, on its ability to attract and maintain customers for its development, manufacturing and technology transfer services and on the amount of customer spending on such services. If iBio CDMO fails to attract customers or its customers’ and potential customers’ spending on iBio CDMO’s services is reduced, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. iBio CDMO’s operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could increase costs and restrict operations in the future.. iBio CDMO’s operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent local and state agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Any failure to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions, or other future liabilities. iBio CDMO is also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and the handling and disposal of regulated material.. Our operating results will be adversely affected if we are unable to maximize our facility capacity utilization.. iBio CDMO’s operating results are significantly influenced by our capacity utilization and, as such, if we are unable to utilize our facilities to capacity, our margins could be adversely affected, and our results of operations and financial condition will continue to be adversely affected. Further, while we continue to implement and execute our business plan and attract and maintain customers for our development, manufacturing and technology transfer services, our revenue volume may be insufficient to ensure the economical operation of our facilities, in which case our results of operations could be adversely affected.. A failure by iBio CDMO to hire and retain an appropriately skilled and adequate workforce could adversely impact the ability of the facility to operate and function efficiently.. iBio CDMO’s operations will depend, in part, on its ability to attract and retain an appropriately skilled and sufficient workforce to operate its development and manufacturing facility. The facility is located in a growing biotechnology hub and competition for skilled workers will continue to increase as the industry undergoes further growth in the area.. Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.. Our industry is highly regulated. We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, provincial, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities in which we manufacture products or in which our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, import and export, and product registration and listing, among other things. As we expand our operations and geographic scope, we may be exposed to more complex and new regulatory and administrative requirements and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in which we have little or no experience. It is possible that compliance with new regulatory requirements could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. 24. Our manufacturing services are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer.. The manufacturing services we offer are highly complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. A failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, viral contamination, failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions, protocols and standard operating procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a single manufacturing run or a series of runs, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt manufacturing operations altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug substance, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs. With respect to our commercial manufacturing, if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.. We depend on spending and demand from our customers for our contract manufacturing and development services and any reduction in spending or demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.. The amount that our customers spend on the development and manufacturing of their products or product candidates, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on outsourcing these services to us, substantially impacts our revenue and profitability. The outcomes of our customers’ research, development and marketing also significantly influence the amount that our customers choose to spend on our services and offerings. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend on our services based upon, among other things, the clinical and market success of their products, available resources, access to capital and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, depend upon a number of other factors, including their competitors’ research, development and product initiatives and the anticipated market for any new products, as well as clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. Further, increasing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may impact such spending, particularly in the event that any of our customers choose to develop or acquire integrated manufacturing operations. Any reduction in customer spending on biologics development and related services as a result of these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.. We may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.. We intend to grow our business operations as demand increases and increase the number of our employees to accommodate such potential growth, which may cause us to experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This potential future growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including manufacturing operations, quality control, technical support and other administrative functions. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls.. As our commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our capacity for manufacturing, customer service, billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. We may also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up and validate, and increase our manufacturing, maintenance, software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. These increases in scale, expansion of personnel, purchase of equipment or process enhancements may not be successfully implemented.. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our customers’ proprietary information, we may be subject to claims.. Many of the formulations used and processes developed by us in manufacturing our customers’ products are subject to trade secret protection, patents or other intellectual property protections owned or licensed by such customer. While we make significant efforts to protect our customers’ proprietary and confidential information, including requiring our employees to enter into agreements protecting such information, if any of our employees breaches the non-disclosure provisions in such agreements, or if our customers make claims that their proprietary information has been disclosed, our reputation may suffer damage and we may become subject to legal proceedings that could require us to incur significant expenses and divert our management’s time, attention and resources.. Our services and our customers’ products may infringe on or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of third parties.. Any claims that our services infringe the rights of third parties, including claims arising from any of our customer engagements, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required, among other things, to pay substantial damages, discontinue the use of the infringing technology, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, license such technology from the third party claiming infringement (which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all) and/or cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing processes or offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. 25. In addition, our customers’ products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured and they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology which we may provide. Any of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we do not enhance our existing or introduce new service offerings in a timely manner, our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time, customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline.. Demand for our manufacturing services may change in ways that we may not anticipate due to evolving industry standards and customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied, as well as the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings. In the event we are unable to offer or enhance our service offerings or expand our manufacturing infrastructure to accommodate requests from our customers and potential customers, our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. For example, if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our customers through enhancing our offerings, our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements. Potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial capital investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations. Even if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings, however, they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of our costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features. Finally, the marketplace may not accept our innovations due to, among other things, existing patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and/or uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.. Revenue amounts generated by iBio CDMO have corresponding percentage rent expense components with minimum amounts due which may adversely impact the Company’s financial position and liquidity as we undergo business development and growth.. In addition to the base rent, iBio CDMO is required to pay to the Second Eastern Affiliate, for each calendar year during the term, a portion of the total gross sales for products manufactured or processed at the facility, equal to 7% of the first $5,000,000 of gross sales, 6% of gross sales between $5,000,001 and $25,000,000, 5% of gross sales between $25,000,001 and $50,000,000, 4% of gross sales between $50,000,001 and $100,000,000, and 3% of gross sales between $100,000,001 and $500,000,000. However, if for any calendar year period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, iBio CDMO’s applicable gross sales are less than $5,000,000, or for any calendar year period from and after January 1, 2020, its applicable gross sales are less than $10,000,000, then iBio CDMO is required to pay the amount that would have been payable if it had achieved such minimum gross sales and shall pay no less than the applicable percentage for the minimum gross sales for each subsequent calendar year. If iBio CDMO does not have sufficient total gross sales to offset this rent expense, it may adversely impact the Company’s financial position and liquidity.. Risks Related to Business Operations. If we acquire companies, products or technologies, we may face integration risks and costs associated with those acquisitions that could negatively impact our business, results from operations and financial condition.. If we are presented with appropriate opportunities, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. We may not realize the anticipated benefit of any acquisition or investment. If we acquire companies or technologies, we will face risks, uncertainties and disruptions associated with the integration process, including difficulties in the integration of the operations of an acquired company, integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business, and impairment charges if future acquisitions are not as successful as we originally anticipate. In addition, our operating results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. Any failure to successfully integrate other companies, products or technologies that we may acquire may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders.. We depend on key personnel and the loss of key personnel could harm our business and results of operations.. We depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees as well as a number of key executives. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain key personnel, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees. Our inability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business.. 26. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock. iBio is subject to compliance under the NYSE American LLC continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide.. On June 6, 2018, the Company received a letter from NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American” or the “Exchange”) stating that it is not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the “Company Guide”), which applies if a listed company has stockholders’ equity of less than $6,000,000 and has sustained losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years. The Exchange indicated that a review of the Company shows that it is below compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) since it reported stockholders’ equity of $4.2 million as of March 31, 2018 and net losses in its five most recent fiscal years.. In order to maintain its listing, the Company submitted a plan for compliance addressing how it intends to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by December 6, 2019.  On August 16, 2018, the Company received notice from NYSE American that NYSE Regulation had accepted the Company’s July 16, 2018 plan and granted a plan period through December 6, 2019, subject to periodic review by the Exchange, including quarterly monitoring, for compliance with the initiatives outlined in the plan. If the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards by December 6, 2019, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the plan during the plan period, NYSE Regulation staff may initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.. As of June 30, 2018, the Company’s stockholders’ equity balance is $16.2 million.. iBio is subject to compliance under the NYSE American LLC continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide, related to securities selling price.. On January 4, 2018, the Company received a letter from NYSE American stating that iBio, Inc.’s securities have been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the Company’s continued listing is predicated on it effecting a reverse stock split of its Common Stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which NYSE American had determined to be no later than July 5, 2018.. On April 23, 2018, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders at which the stockholders approved a proposal to effect an amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended, to implement a reverse stock split at a ratio to be determined by the Company's Board of Directors in a range not less than one-for-two (1:2) and not greater than one-for-ten (1:10).. On May 23, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved the implementation of a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-ten (1:10) shares of the Company's common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every ten (10) shares of the Company's common stock either issued and outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury immediately prior to the effective time was, automatically and without any action on the part of the respective holders thereof, combined and converted into one (1) share of the Company's common stock. The reverse split also applied to common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Company’s outstanding stock options. The reverse stock split did not affect the par value of the Company’s common stock or the shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise were entitled to receive a fractional share in connection with the reverse stock split instead were eligible to receive a cash payment, which was not material in the aggregate, instead of shares. The effective date of the reverse stock split was June 8, 2018. All share and per share amounts of common stock presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-ten reverse stock split.. On July 5, 2018, the Company received a letter from NYSE American informing the Company that it has resolved the deficiency with respect to low selling price, described in Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company guide and was back in compliance. On September 13, 2018, the closing price of the Company’s common stock was $0.84.. Our operating results may vary significantly in the future, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.. It is likely that our operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. It is also possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts and investors. If we do not meet these expectations, the price of our common stock may decline significantly.. 27. Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and provisions of applicable Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock. Any additional issuance of common stock could have the effect of impeding or discouraging the acquisition of control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, including a transaction in which our stockholders would receive a premium over the market price for their shares, and thereby protect the continuity of our management. Specifically, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors were to determine that a takeover proposal was not in our best interest, shares could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval in one or more transactions that might prevent or render more difficult or costly the completion of the takeover by:. ·     Diluting the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder group,. ·     Putting a substantial voting bloc in institutional or other hands that might undertake to support the incumbent Board of Directors, or. ·     Effecting an acquisition that might complicate or preclude the takeover.. Our certificate of incorporation also allows our Board of Directors to fix the number of directors in the by-laws. Cumulative voting in the election of directors is specifically denied in our certificate of incorporation. The effect of these provisions may be to delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder may determine to be in his, her or its best interest, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by the stockholders.. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends or distributions on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings to support operations and to finance expansion and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.. The sale of our common stock through current or future equity offerings may cause dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.. We are entitled under our certificate of incorporation to issue up to 275 million shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, and 1 million shares of preferred stock. Preferred stock issued is as follows:. 1.iBio CMO Preferred Tracking Stock, par value, $0.001.. 2.Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value, $0.001 (“Series A Preferred”). 3.Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value, $0.001 (“Series B Preferred”). Public offering. On November 30, 2017, the Company closed a public offering of 2,250,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $2.00 per share raising gross proceeds of $4,500,000. The shares of common stock were issued pursuant to an underwriting agreement entered into between the Company and Aegis Capital Corp. (“Aegis”). The Company paid Aegis a discount of 7% to the public offering price with respect to shares purchased in the offering by investors who did not have a pre-existing relationship with the Company prior to the offering (the “New Investors”), and a discount of 3.5% to the public offering price with respect to shares purchased in the offering by investors who did have a pre-existing relationship with the Company. In addition to the underwriting discounts, the Company issued to the Underwriter 11,000 shares of its common stock, equal to 2% of the aggregate shares of common stock sold in the offering to the New Investors. The Company incurred underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses of $311,000 related to closing and completion of this public offering.. On June 26, 2018, the Company closed on an underwritten public offering with total gross proceeds of approximately $16,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The securities offered by the Company consisted of (i) 4,350,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share, (ii) 6,300 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1,000 per preferred share, and convertible into an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share, (iii) 5,785 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1,000 per preferred share, and convertible into an aggregate of 6,427,778 shares of Common Stock at $0.90 per share.

On July 12, 2018, the Company received approximately $1,350,000, before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses payable by the Company, from the proceeds of the sale of 1,500,000 over-allotment shares of Common Stock purchased at $0.90 by the underwriter during the 45-day provision.. As of August 30, 2018, we had issued and outstanding approximately 18.3 million shares of common stock, one share of iBio CMO Preferred Tracking Stock, 5,538 shares of Series A Preferred and 5,785 shares of Series B Preferred. As of August 30, 2018, 1.36 million options to purchase shares of common stock were outstanding and we had approximately 135,000 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance of additional option grants under our 2008 Amended and Restated Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.. In addition, we had approximately 12.6 million shares of common stock reserved for future possible conversions of the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred. Accordingly, we will be able to issue up to approximately 229.1 million additional shares of common stock and 987,914 shares of preferred stock. Sales of our common stock offered through current or future equity offerings may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to investors, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.. 28. The issuance of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 987,914 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the voting rights, rights of redemption and other rights and preferences of preferred stock. Currently, we have one share of preferred stock outstanding. Our Board of Directors may, at any time, authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock, and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, before the redemption of our common stock, which may have a material adverse effect on the rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors, without further stockholder approval, may, at any time, issue large blocks of preferred stock. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of our company and may prevent a transaction that is favorable to our stockholders.. Risks Related to Our Stock Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. Sales of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and the sale of the shares of our common stock acquired by Lincoln Park could cause the price of our common stock to decline.. On July 24, 2017, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park pursuant to which Lincoln Park has agreed to purchase from us up to an aggregate of $16,000,000 of our common stock (subject to certain limitations) from time to time over the 36-month term of the agreement (the “Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement”). As a result, on July 24, 2017, 120,000 shares of our common stock were issued to Lincoln Park as consideration for Lincoln Park’s commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the agreement, and 250,000 shares of common stock were sold to Lincoln Park in an initial purchase for an aggregate gross purchase price of $1,000,000.. During March 2018, the Company sold an additional 60,000 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park for an aggregate gross purchase price of $121,290. We may direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to an additional $14,878,710 worth of shares of our common stock (excluding the initial purchase) under our agreement over a 36-month period generally in amounts up to 10,000 shares of our common stock, which may be increased to up to 60,000 shares of our common stock depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of sale and subject to a maximum limit of $1,000,000 per purchase, on any such business day.. The number of shares ultimately offered for sale to Lincoln Park is dependent upon the number of shares we elect to sell to Lincoln Park under the agreement. Depending upon market liquidity at the time, sales of shares of our common stock under the agreement with Lincoln Park may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all or only some of the $16.0 million of our common stock that we may sell under the agreement. After Lincoln Park acquires shares under the agreement, it may sell all, some or none of those shares. Sales to Lincoln Park by us pursuant to the agreement may result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales. However, we have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park and the agreement with Lincoln Park may be terminated by us at any time at our discretion without any cost to us. The agreement with Lincoln Park is more fully described under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.. Our management will have broad discretion over the amounts, timing and use of the net proceeds that we may receive pursuant to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, you may not agree with how we use the proceeds, and the proceeds may not be invested successfully.. Our management will have broad discretion in the timing and application of any net proceeds that we may receive from any future sales of common stock to Lincoln Park pursuant to the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. Management could use these proceeds for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of this prospectus. Accordingly, you will be relying on the judgment of our management with regard to the timing and use of these net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. It is possible that the proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable, or any, return for our company.. We may not be able to access the full amounts available under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, which could prevent us from accessing the capital we need to continue our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.. Other than the Initial Purchase Amount, all funds available under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement are only available if our common stock per share value is $2.50 or higher at the time we seek to sell stock, and the volume of any such stock sales under the Purchase Agreement may vary with our common stock per share price. Changes in our stock price may limit the net proceeds we may receive under the Purchase Agreement."
