[1] "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Investing in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as the risks, uncertainties and other information set forth in the reports and other materials filed or furnished by our majority-controlled subsidiaries National, Checkpoint, Mustang, and Avenue with the SEC, before deciding to invest in shares of our Common Stock. If any of the following risks or the risks included in the public filings of National, Checkpoint, Mustang or Avenue were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose part of or all of your investment in our Common Stock.. 11. Risks Related to our Growth Strategy. If we acquire, enter into joint ventures with or obtain a controlling interest in companies in the future, it could adversely affect our operating results and the value of our Common Stock thereby diluting stockholder value and disrupting our business.. As part of our growth strategy, we might acquire, enter into joint ventures with, or obtain a significant ownership stake in other companies. Acquisitions of, joint ventures with and investments in other companies involve numerous risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:. ·risk                                          of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience;. ·diversion                                          of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;. ·successfully                                          negotiating a proposed acquisition or investment timely and at a price or on terms and                                          conditions favorable to us;. ·the                                          impact of regulatory reviews on a proposed acquisition or investment;. ·the                                          outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted with respect to the proposed                                          acquisitions or investment;. ·with                                          respect to an acquisition, difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services                                          and personnel; and. ·potential                                          inability to maintain relationships with customers of the companies we may acquire or                                          invest in.. If we fail to properly evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures or investments, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, we might incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, and management resources and attention might be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities.. If certain of our subsidiaries cannot innovate and develop products and services and/or continue to commercialize biopharmaceutical products or grow our and their respective businesses, we may not be able to generate revenue.. Our growth strategy also depends on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to generate revenue. If we and our subsidiaries cannot innovate and develop products and services or continue to commercialize current and future biopharmaceutical products or grow their respective businesses, we may not be able to generate revenue growth as anticipated.. We may not be able to generate returns for our investors if certain of our subsidiaries, most of which have limited or no operating history, no commercialized revenue generating products, and are not yet profitable, cannot obtain additional third-party financing.. As part of our growth strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make substantial investments in our subsidiaries, which at the time of investment generally have limited or no operating history, no commercialized revenue generating products, and require additional third-party financing to fund product and services development or acquisitions. Our business depends in large part on one or more of our subsidiaries’ ability to innovate, in-license, acquire or invest in successful biopharmaceutical products, develop financial services and/or acquire companies in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. If certain of our subsidiaries do not successfully obtain additional third-party financing to commercialize products, successfully acquire companies or participate in the financial services industry, as applicable, the value of our businesses and our ownership stakes in our subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected.. If we cannot continue to fund our and certain of our subsidiaries’ research and development programs, we and our subsidiaries may be required to reduce product development, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.. Our and certain of our subsidiaries’ research and development (“R&D”) programs will require substantial additional capital to conduct research, preclinical testing and human studies, establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities, and establish and develop quality control, regulatory, marketing, sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs. We expect to fund our and certain of our subsidiaries’ R&D activities from a combination of cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past, ongoing and future collaborations and additional equity or debt financings from third parties. These financings could depress our stock price. If additional funds are required to support our or our subsidiaries’ operations and such funds cannot be obtained on favorable terms, we and certain of our subsidiaries may not be able to develop products, which will adversely impact our growth strategy.. 12. Collaborative relationships with third parties could cause us or certain of our subsidiaries to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of financial return.. We anticipate substantial reliance upon strategic collaborations for marketing and commercializing our and certain of our subsidiaries’ existing product candidates, and we and our subsidiaries may rely even more on strategic collaborations for R&D of other product candidates. We and certain of our subsidiaries may sell product offerings through strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to establish or manage such strategic collaborations on terms favorable to us in the future, our revenue and drug development may be limited.. If we or certain of our subsidiaries enter into R&D collaborations during the early phases of drug development, success will in part depend on the performance of research collaborators. Neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries will directly control the amount or timing of resources devoted by research collaborators to activities related to product candidates. Research collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our or our subsidiaries’ R&D programs. If any research collaborator fails to commit sufficient resources, the preclinical or clinical development programs related to the collaboration could be delayed or terminated. Also, collaborators may pursue existing or other development-stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us or our subsidiaries. Finally, if we or certain of our subsidiaries fail to make required milestone or royalty payments to collaborators or to observe other obligations in agreements with them, the collaborators may have the right to terminate or stop performance of those agreements.. Establishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our and certain of our subsidiaries’ discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our and our subsidiaries’ financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. In addition, there has been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we or our subsidiaries successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product revenues are likely to be lower than if we or our subsidiaries directly marketed and sold products. Such collaborators may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us or our subsidiaries for any future product candidate.. Management of our relationships with collaborators will require:. ·significant                                          time and effort from our management team, as well as from the management teams of our                                          subsidiaries;. ·coordination                                          of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ marketing and R&D programs with the                                          respective marketing and R&D priorities of our collaborators; and. ·effective                                          allocation of our and our subsidiaries’ resources to multiple projects.. As we continue to execute our growth strategy, we may be subject to further government regulation which would adversely affect our operations.. If we engage in business combinations and other transactions that result in holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we may become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If we do become subject to the Investment Company Act, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs in the future.. 13. We may not be able to manage our anticipated growth, which may in turn adversely impact our business.. We will need to continue to expend funds on improving our infrastructure to address our anticipated growth. Acquisitions of companies or products could place a strain on our management, and administrative, operational and financial systems. In addition, we may need to hire, train and manage more employees, focusing on their integration with us and corporate culture. Integration and management issues associated with increased acquisitions may require a disproportionate amount of our management’s time and attention and distract our management from other activities related to running our business.. We may not be able to hire or retain key officers or employees for our Company, and in some cases, our subsidiaries, to implement our business strategy and develop products and businesses.. Our success depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers, financial, scientific and technical personnel and consultants, and on our ability to attract additional personnel for us and, in some cases, our subsidiaries as we continue to implement our growth strategy and acquire and invest in companies with varied businesses. During our and our subsidiaries’ operating history, many essential responsibilities have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. However, as we continue to implement our growth strategy and our subsidiaries grow, the demands on our key employees will expand and we will need to recruit additional qualified employees for us and, possibly, for our subsidiaries. The competition for such qualified personnel is intense, and the loss of services of certain key personnel or our or our subsidiaries’ inability to attract additional personnel to fill critical positions could adversely affect our business.. We currently depend heavily upon the efforts and abilities of our management team and the management teams of our subsidiaries. The loss or unavailability of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results. In addition, we have not obtained, do not own, nor are we the beneficiary of key-person life insurance for any of our and our subsidiaries’ key personnel. We only maintain a limited amount of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage. There can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover the costs of the events that may occur, in which case, there could be a substantial impact on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to continue operations.. Our and our subsidiaries’ employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.. We and our subsidiaries are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third party partners could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us and our subsidiaries. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we and our subsidiaries take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us and our subsidiaries from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us or our subsidiaries, and we or our subsidiaries are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.. We and our subsidiaries receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we and our subsidiaries have in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us and our subsidiaries to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we and our subsidiaries have generated based off such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our and our subsidiaries’ employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made to our competitor companies.. 14. Certain of our officers and directors serve in similar roles with our subsidiaries, affiliates, related parties and other parties with whom we transact business; ongoing and future relationships and transactions between these parties could result in conflicts of interest.. We share directors and/or officers with certain of our subsidiaries, affiliates, related parties or other companies with which we transact business, and such arrangements could create conflicts of interest in the future, including with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities. While we believe that we have put in place policies and procedures to identify such conflicts and that any existing agreements that may give rise to such conflicts and any such policies or procedures were negotiated at arm’s length in conformity with fiduciary duties, such conflicts of interest may nonetheless arise. The existence and consequences of such potential conflicts could expose us and our subsidiaries to lost profits, claims by our investors and creditors, and harm to our and our subsidiaries’ results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Biopharmaceutical Business and Industry. We are an early-stage company, with limited operating history on which stockholders can base an investment decision; we also have numerous early-stage subsidiaries that rely heavily on third parties for the development and manufacturing of their products and product candidates.. We are primarily an early-stage biopharmaceutical company and certain of our subsidiaries, on whose success we largely rely, are also early-stage biopharmaceutical companies. To date, we and certain of our subsidiaries have engaged primarily in R&D and investment activities and have not generated any revenues from product sales. We and certain of our subsidiaries have incurred significant net losses since our inception. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $312.1 million. We and certain of our subsidiaries have not demonstrated the ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any of our products. The successful commercialization of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ products will require us and our subsidiaries to perform or contract with third parties for performance of a variety of critical functions, including, but not necessarily limited to:. ·identifying,                                          developing, and commercializing product candidates;. ·entering                                          into successful licensing and other arrangements with product development partners;. ·continuing                                          to undertake pre-clinical development and designing and executing clinical trials;. ·participating                                          in regulatory approval processes;. ·formulating                                          and manufacturing products for clinical development programs and commercial sale; and. ·conducting                                          sales and marketing activities.. Our operations have been limited to acquiring, developing and securing the proprietary rights for, and undertaking pre-clinical development and clinical trials of product candidates, and making investments in other companies. These operations provide a limited basis for our stockholders and prospective investors to assess our ability to commercialize product candidates, develop potential product candidates and make successful investments in other companies, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities. Each of these requirements will require substantial time, effort and financial resources.. If we or certain of our subsidiaries are unable to establish or maintain sales and marketing capabilities or fail to enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute and sell products that may be successfully developed, neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to effectively market and sell products and continue to generate product revenue.. Neither we nor our biopharmaceutical subsidiaries (other than Journey Medical Corporation) currently have the infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of any of our product candidates, and we and certain of our subsidiaries must build and maintain this infrastructure or make arrangements with third parties to perform these functions in order to continue to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. The establishment and development of a sales force, either by us, certain of our subsidiaries or jointly with a partner, or the establishment of a contract sales force to market any products we or our subsidiaries may develop, is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch or compromise the successful commercialization of products. If we, certain of our subsidiaries, or our respective partners, are unable to establish and maintain sales and marketing capabilities or any other non-technical capabilities necessary to commercialize any products that may be successfully developed, we or certain of our subsidiaries will need to contract with third parties to market and sell such products. We or certain of our subsidiaries may not be able to establish arrangements with third parties on acceptable terms, or at all.. 15. If any of our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates that are successfully developed do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates generate from sales will be limited.. Even if our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally is also necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products will depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:. ·the                                          efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;. ·the                                          timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;. ·the                                          clinical indications for which the product is approved;. ·acceptance                                          by physicians, major operators of hospitals and clinics and patients of the product as                                          a safe and effective treatment;. ·the                                          potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;. ·the                                          safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside                                          the approved indications;. ·the                                          cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;. ·the                                          availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;. ·the                                          approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for a companion diagnostic,                                          if any;. ·changes                                          in regulatory requirements by government authorities for our product candidates;. ·relative                                          convenience and ease of administration;. ·the                                          prevalence and severity of side effects and adverse events;. ·the                                          effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and. ·unfavorable                                          publicity relating to the product.. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we or certain of our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient revenue from these products and in turn we may not become or remain profitable.. Healthcare reform and changes to restrictions on reimbursements are difficult to predict and may limit our financial returns.. Our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries and all of our respective collaborators to commercialize product candidates that are successfully developed may depend, in part, on the extent to which government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse consumers for the cost of these products. These third parties are increasingly challenging both the need for and the price of new drug products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates, which would prevent those product candidates from selling at price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investments in research and product development.. Additionally, we are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations related to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. The Affordable Care Act and any revisions or replacements of that Act, any substitute legislation, and other changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:. ·an                                          annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures, or imports specified branded                                          prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to                                          their market share in certain government healthcare programs;. 16. ·an                                          increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid                                          Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded                                          and generic drugs, respectively;. ·expansion                                          of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal                                          Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for                                          non-compliance;. ·a                                          new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree                                          to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs                                          to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s                                          outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;. ·extension                                          of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals                                          who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;. ·expansion                                          of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states                                          to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility                                          categories for certain individuals with income at or below 138% of the federal poverty                                          level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;. ·expansion                                          of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program;. ·the                                          new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;. ·a                                          new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide                                          to physicians; and. ·a                                          new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in,                                          and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such                                          research.. The Supreme Court upheld the ACA in the main challenge to the constitutionality of the law in 2012. The Supreme Court also upheld federal subsidies for purchasers of insurance through federally facilitated exchanges in a decision released in June 2015. Any remaining legal challenges to the ACA are viewed generally as not significantly impacting the implementation of the law if the plaintiffs prevail.. The U.S. President signed an Executive Order in 2017 instructing federal agencies to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others. Modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the ACA have been attempted in Congress as a result of the outcome of the recent presidential and congressional elections, consistent with statements made by the incoming administration and members of Congress during the presidential and congressional campaigns and following the election. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law. However, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. In March 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the American Health Care Act of 2017, which, if enacted, would amend or repeal significant portions of the ACA. Attempts in the Senate in 2017 to pass similar ACA repeal legislation, including the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, were unsuccessful. However, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which includes a provision that effectively repeals the ACA’s individual mandate by reducing the tax penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential coverage to zero.. Legislative proposals such as expanding the Medicaid drug rebate program to the Medicare Part D program, providing authority for the government to negotiate drug prices under the Medicare Part D program and lowering reimbursement for drugs covered under the Medicare Part B program have been raised in Congress but have been met with opposition and have not been enacted so far.. The administration can rely on its existing statutory authority to make policy changes that could have an impact on the drug industry. For example, the Medicare program has in the past proposed to test alternative payment methodologies for drugs covered under the Part B program and finalized a proposal to pay hospitals less for Part B-covered drugs purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program effective January 1, 2018.. We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.. 17. The United Kingdom’s announced withdrawal from the EU could have a negative effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, EU regulatory procedures and our business.. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom, or the UK, elected in a national referendum to withdraw from the EU. In March 2017, the UK government formally initiated the withdrawal process. That pending withdrawal, currently scheduled to occur in or before March 2019, has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate upon withdrawal. The pending withdrawal has also given rise to calls for the governments of other EU member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU also means that the EMA, from which we and certain of our subsidiaries must obtain approval to sell any product in the EU, must relocate from its current headquarters in the UK to a new location within the EU. This relocation of the EMA could significantly disrupt its operations, which could cause delays in the EMA’s review and approval of marketing authorization applications. Such a disruption could impact any future applications for EMA approval of our and our subsidiaries’ drug candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and growth prospects.. Our, and our subsidiaries’, current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us or our subsidiaries to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the US and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we, or our subsidiaries, obtain marketing approval. Our, and our subsidiaries’, future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we and our subsidiaries sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we or our subsidiaries may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate, or our subsidiaries’ ability to operate, include, but are not necessarily limited to:. ·the                                          federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly                                          and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or                                          indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral                                          of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service,                                          for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare                                          and Medicaid;. ·federal                                          civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal                                          False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower                                          or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing                                          to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs,                                          claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid,                                          decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; the federal                                          Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes                                          criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit                                          program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;. ·HIPAA,                                          as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act                                          of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations                                          on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well                                          as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually                                          identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to                                          safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health                                          information;. 18. ·the                                          federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices,                                          biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid                                          or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report                                          annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related                                          to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians, which is defined                                          to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and teaching                                          hospitals and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations                                          to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and                                          their immediate family members. Data collection began on August 1, 2013 with requirements                                          for manufacturers to submit reports to CMS by March 31, 2014 and 90 days after the end                                          each subsequent calendar year. Disclosure of such information was made by CMS on a publicly                                          available website beginning in September 2014; and. ·analogous                                          state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims                                          laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare                                          items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private                                          insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with                                          the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant                                          compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments                                          that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers                                          to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians                                          and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws                                          governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many                                          of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA,                                          thus complicating compliance efforts.. Efforts to ensure that our business and our subsidiaries’ business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our or our subsidiaries’ business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our or our subsidiaries’ operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.. Failure to be included in formularies developed by managed care organizations and coverage by other organizations may negatively impact the utilization of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ products, which could harm our and our subsidiaries’ market shares and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Managed care organizations and other third party payors try to negotiate the pricing of medical services and products to control their costs. Managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers typically develop formularies to reduce their cost for medications. Formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products. Due to their lower costs, generic products are often favored. The breadth of the products covered by formularies varies considerably from one managed care organization to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical conditions. Failure to be included in such formularies or to achieve favorable formulary status may negatively impact the utilization and market share of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ products. If our and our subsidiaries’ products are not included within an adequate number of formularies or adequate reimbursement levels are not provided, or if those policies increasingly favor generic products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.. Our product candidates and certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates are at an early stage of development and may not be successfully developed or commercialized.. Our existing product candidates, and most of our subsidiaries’ product candidates remain in the early stage of development and will require substantial further capital expenditures, development, testing and regulatory clearances prior to commercialization. The development and regulatory approval process takes several years, and it is not likely that our product candidates or all our subsidiaries’ product candidates, even if successfully developed and approved by the FDA, would be commercially available for several years. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA regulatory approval process and is commercialized. Accordingly, even if we and our subsidiaries are able to obtain the requisite financing to fund development programs, we cannot assure you that any of our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized, which could result in the failure of our business and a loss of your investment in our Company.. 19. Because we and certain of our subsidiaries in-license certain product candidates from third parties, any dispute with the licensors or the non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.. All of our existing product candidates and certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates, including related intellectual property rights, were in-licensed from third parties. Under the terms of the license agreements, the licensors generally have the right to terminate such agreements in the event of a material breach. The licenses require us and certain of our subsidiaries to make annual, milestone or other payments prior to commercialization of any product and our and our subsidiaries’ ability to make these payments depends on the ability to generate cash in the future. These license agreements also generally require the use of diligent and reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize product candidates.. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us or one of our subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the respective licensing partner, on the other hand, regarding the rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from a failure to satisfy payment obligations under such agreements, the ability to develop and commercialize the affected product candidate may be adversely affected.. The types of disputes which may arise between us and our subsidiaries and the third parties from whom we and our subsidiaries license intellectual property include, but are not limited to:. ·the                                          scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related                                          issues;. ·the                                          extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the                                          licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;. ·the                                          sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative                                          development relationships, and the rights and obligations associated with such sublicensing;. ·the                                          diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific                                          diligence milestones) and what activities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;. ·whether                                          or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been                                          achieved or satisfied;. ·the                                          applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;. ·the                                          permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential                                          third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the subject of such license                                          agreements;. ·the                                          calculation of royalty, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license                                          agreements;. ·the                                          extent to which license rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license                                          agreements;. ·whether                                          or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to                                          which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure                                          periods, if any;. ·disputes                                          regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding                                          past and ongoing patent expenses;. ·the                                          inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation                                          or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and. ·the                                          priority of invention of patented technology.. In addition, the agreements under which we and our subsidiaries currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our and our subsidiaries’ rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our and our subsidiaries’ financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we or our subsidiaries have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we or our subsidiaries may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.. 20. Product candidates that we or certain of our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.. Pharmaceutical development has inherent risk. We and certain of our subsidiaries will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before seeking regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, as product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Also, we or our subsidiaries may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. As a result, product candidates that we or our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.. In addition, even if our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of such product candidates or any future product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we or our subsidiaries request, may not approve the price we or our subsidiaries intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of these scenarios could compromise the commercial prospects for one or more of our or our subsidiaries current or future product candidates.. Moreover, in all interactions with regulatory authorities, the company is exposed to liability risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws.. Any product candidates we or certain of our subsidiaries advance into clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize product candidates.. The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, and certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, neither we nor our subsidiaries are permitted to market our product candidates until such product candidate’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or New Drug Application is approved by the FDA. The process of obtaining approval is expensive, often takes many years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. Certain of our subsidiaries’ development of individualized immunotherapies, if any, will face similar challenges. In addition to the significant clinical testing requirements, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our and our subsidiaries’ product candidates and validation of our and our subsidiaries’ manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our or our subsidiaries’ product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or facilities are insufficient to justify approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.. The FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:. ·the                                          FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation                                          of our clinical trials or those of certain of our subsidiaries;. ·our                                          or certain of our subsidiaries’ inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of                                          the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;. ·the                                          FDA may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted by individual investigators                                          or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that of the                                          United States;. 21. ·the                                          results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required                                          by the FDA for approval;. ·the                                          FDA may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical                                          trials;. ·the                                          FDA may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party                                          manufacturers with which we, or certain of our subsidiaries or our respective collaborators                                          contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or. ·the                                          approval policies or regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering                                          the clinical data insufficient for approval or the product characteristics or benefit-risk                                          profile unfavorable for approval.. With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, recent events raising questions about the safety of certain marketed pharmaceuticals may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us or our subsidiaries from commercializing our product candidates.. Any product candidate we or certain of our subsidiaries advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization or limit their commercial potential.. Unacceptable adverse events caused by any of our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates that we advance into clinical trials could cause regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or stop clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications and markets. This, in turn, could prevent us or certain of our subsidiaries from commercializing the affected product candidate and generating revenues from its sale. For example, in Phase 1/2 oncology trials, dose limiting toxicity (“DLT”) stopping rules are commonly applied.. Neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries have completed testing of all our product candidates for the treatment of the indications for which we intend to seek product approval in humans, and we currently do not know the extent of adverse events, if any, that will be observed in patients who receive any of our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates. If any of our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates cause unacceptable adverse events in clinical trials, neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize such products or, if such product candidates are approved for marketing, future adverse events could cause us or certain of our subsidiaries to withdraw such products from the market.. Delays in the commencement of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our or certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to pursue regulatory approval.. The commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:. ·obtaining                                          regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial;. ·identifying,                                          recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;. ·reaching                                          agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (“CROs”)                                          and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject                                          to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and                                          trial sites;. ·obtaining                                          sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;. ·obtaining                                          Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee approval to conduct                                          a clinical trial at a prospective site;. ·identifying,                                          recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; and. ·retaining                                          (or replacing) patients who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw due to adverse                                          events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process                                          or personal issues.. 22. Any delays in the commencement of our or certain of our subsidiaries’ clinical trials will delay our or our subsidiaries’ ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.. Suspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and delay or prevent our or certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to complete development of that product or generate product revenues.. Once a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us or our subsidiaries, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:. ·failure                                          to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our or our                                          subsidiaries’ clinical protocols;. ·inspection                                          of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory                                          authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;. ·stopping                                          rules contained in the protocol;. ·unforeseen                                          safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health                                          risks; and. ·lack                                          of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.. Changes in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur, and we or certain of our subsidiaries may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us or certain of our subsidiaries to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may in turn impact the costs and timing of, and the likelihood of successfully completing, a clinical trial. If we or our subsidiaries experience delays in the completion of, or if we must suspend or terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our ability or the ability of our subsidiaries to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.. Even if approved, any product candidates that we or certain of our subsidiaries may develop and market may be later withdrawn from the market or subject to promotional limitations.. Neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries may be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates if approved. We and certain of our subsidiaries may also be required to undertake post-marketing clinical trials. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory or if adverse events or other safety issues arise after approval, the FDA or a comparable regulatory agency in another country may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our subsidiaries that may be expensive and/or time consuming to complete. In addition, if we or others identify adverse side effects after any of our or our subsidiaries’ products are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur, regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our or our subsidiaries’ products, additional clinical trials, changes in labeling of our or our subsidiaries’ products and additional marketing applications may be required. Any reformulation or labeling changes may limit the marketability of such products if approved.. We and certain of our subsidiaries currently rely predominantly on third parties to manufacture our preclinical and clinical pharmaceutical supplies and expect to continue to rely heavily on them and other contractors to produce commercial supplies of our products, and our dependence on third-party suppliers could adversely impact our business.. We and certain of our subsidiaries depend heavily on third party manufacturers for product supply. If our or our subsidiaries’ contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and with FDA regulatory requirements, we will not be able to secure and/or maintain FDA approval for those products. Our and our subsidiaries’ third-party suppliers will be required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and will be subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies and authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. In the event that the FDA or such other agencies determine that our third-party suppliers have not complied with cGMP or comparable authorities, the relevant clinical trials could be terminated or subjected to a clinical hold until such time as we are able to obtain appropriate replacement material and/or applicable compliance and commercial product could be unfit for sale. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our and our subsidiaries’ products.. 23. We and certain of our subsidiaries also rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce product candidates for anticipated clinical trials. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that are used to manufacture those products. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the supply the raw material components for an ongoing clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our and our subsidiaries’ clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval.. We do not expect to have the resources or capacity to commercially manufacture our and certain of our subsidiaries’ products internally, if approved, and will likely continue to be heavily dependent upon third-party manufacturers. Our dependence on third parties to manufacture and supply clinical trial materials and any approved products may adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ ability to develop and commercialize products in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all.. We and certain of our subsidiaries rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet agreed upon deadlines or otherwise conduct the trials as required, our or our subsidiaries’ clinical development programs could be delayed or unsuccessful and neither we nor our subsidiaries may be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates when expected or at all.. Neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries have the ability to conduct all aspects of our preclinical testing or clinical trials ourselves. We and certain of our subsidiaries intend to and do use CROs to conduct planned clinical trials and will and do rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with specified clinical protocols. These CROs, investigators and other third parties will and do play a significant role in the conduct of our and certain of our subsidiaries’ trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from the clinical trials.. There is no guarantee that any CROs, investigators and other third parties upon which we and our subsidiaries rely for administration and conduct of our clinical trials will devote adequate time and resources to such trials or perform as contractually required. If any of these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to adhere to our clinical protocols or otherwise perform in a substandard manner, our or our subsidiaries’ clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. If any of the clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we or our subsidiaries may lose follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless the care of those patients is transferred to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for our and our subsidiaries’ clinical trials may serve as scientific advisers or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be jeopardized.. We and certain of our subsidiaries rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.. As part of the strategy implemented by us and our subsidiaries to mitigate development risk, we and certain of our subsidiaries seek to develop product candidates with validated mechanisms of action and we utilize biomarkers to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical data and other results produced or obtained by third parties, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. If the third party data and results we and certain of our subsidiaries rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable or not applicable to the product candidates of us and our subsidiaries, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about the product candidates of us and our subsidiaries, and our research and development efforts could be compromised and called into question during the review or any marketing applications we submit.. 24. If our competitors develop treatments for any of the target indications of our or certain of our subsidiaries’ product candidates that are approved more quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity with respect to that product candidate will be reduced or eliminated.. We and certain of our subsidiaries operate in highly competitive segments of the biopharmaceutical markets and face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our and our subsidiaries’ product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will compete with established therapies, as well as new treatments that may be introduced by our competitors. Many of our and our subsidiaries’ competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than those of ours and our subsidiaries. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in clinical and pre-clinical research, some in direct competition with us. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. New developments, including the development of other biological and pharmaceutical technologies and methods of treating disease, occur in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries at a rapid pace. Developments by competitors may render our and our subsidiaries’ product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. We and our subsidiaries will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.. We or certain of our subsidiaries may incur substantial product liability or indemnification claims relating to the clinical testing of product candidates.. We and certain of our subsidiaries face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of product candidates in human clinical trials, and claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of one of our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. While we and our subsidiaries have and/or intend to maintain product liability insurance relating to clinical trials, that coverage may not be sufficient to cover potential claims and we or our subsidiaries may be unable to maintain such insurance. Any claims against us or our subsidiaries, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our or our subsidiaries’ financial condition, strain management and other resources or destroy the prospects for commercialization of the product which is the subject of any such claim. We are unable to predict if we or our subsidiaries will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance for any products that may be approved for marketing. Additionally, we and certain of our subsidiaries have entered into various agreements under which we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to product candidates. These indemnification obligations may require us or our subsidiaries to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnifications.. We and certain of our subsidiaries may use biological materials and hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.. We and certain of our subsidiaries may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our and certain of our subsidiaries’ operations may also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our product development efforts. In addition, neither we nor our subsidiaries can entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Neither we nor our subsidiaries carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we or any of our subsidiaries could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our respective resources, and clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover costs and expenses incurred due to injuries to our and our subsidiaries’ employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Neither we nor our subsidiaries maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted in connection with the storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.. In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.. 25. Our success depends upon our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights and take advantage of certain regulatory market exclusivity periods.. Our success depends, in large part, on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to obtain patent protection for product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we, our subsidiaries, or our respective partners will be successful in obtaining patents. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:. ·patent                                          applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents                                          may not extend to competitive product candidates and their formulations and uses developed                                          or produced by others;. ·our                                          and our subsidiaries’ competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources                                          than us, our subsidiaries, or our partners, and many of which have made significant investments                                          in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit                                          or interfere with our or our subsidiaries’ ability to make, use, and sell potential                                          product candidates;. ·there                                          may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental                                          bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States                                          for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide                                          health concerns; and. ·countries                                          other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those                                          upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop                                          and market competing products.. In addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we or our subsidiaries may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the PTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our US patent position. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates and those of our subsidiaries, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to develop and commercialize or products may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us or our subsidiaries from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders. For example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law, and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include changes to transition from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first-to-file” system and to the way issued patents are challenged. The formation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board now provides a quicker and less expensive process for challenging issued patents. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have more resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO implemented the America Invents Act on March 16, 2013.. We and our subsidiaries and our respective partners also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and our subsidiaries’ trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.. 26. We also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our or our subsidiaries’ biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period, as initially proposed by President Obama. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our and our subsidiaries’ patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our or our subsidiaries’ products, which would materially adversely affect us.. If we, certain of our subsidiaries or our respective partners are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.. Our success also depends on our ability, many of our subsidiaries’ ability and the ability of any of our respective current or future collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our subsidiaries are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our subsidiaries’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates of which we are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the US and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we and our subsidiaries cannot know with certainty whether we and our subsidiaries or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications that we and our subsidiaries own or licensed, or that we and our subsidiaries or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a US patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention in the US. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain.. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third-party claims that we, our subsidiaries or any of our respective licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party’s intellectual property rights, we or our subsidiaries may have to, among other things:. ·obtain                                          licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;. ·abandon                                          an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement;. ·pay                                          substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’                                          fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes                                          on or violates the third party’s rights;. ·pay                                          substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to product candidates; and/or. ·defend                                          litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and                                          which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources.. We or certain of our subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce patents or the patents of licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.. Competitors may infringe our or certain of our subsidiaries’ patents or the patents of our respective licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we or our subsidiaries assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us or our subsidiaries alleging that we or our subsidiaries infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the PTO to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our subsidiaries is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our subsidiaries’ patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our or our subsidiaries’ patents at risk of being invalidated, found to be unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and could likewise put patent applications at risk of not issuing. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our or our subsidiaries’ confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.. 27. We or certain of our subsidiaries may be subject to claims that our or our subsidiaries’ consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us or our subsidiaries alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers.. As is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we and certain of our subsidiaries engage the services of consultants to assist in the development of product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other pharmaceutical companies, including our and our subsidiaries’ competitors or potential competitors. We or our subsidiaries may become subject to claims related to whether these consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we or our subsidiaries are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.. Any product for which we or our subsidiaries obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we or our subsidiaries may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with products, when and if any of them is approved.. Any product for which we or our subsidiaries obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping, and requirements regarding company presentations and interactions with healthcare professionals. Even if we or our subsidiaries obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We or our subsidiaries also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:. ·restrictions                                          on product manufacturing, distribution or use;. ·restrictions                                          on the labeling or marketing of a product;. ·requirements                                          to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;. ·warning                                          letters;. ·withdrawal                                          of the products from the market;. ·refusal                                          to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we or our                                          subsidiaries submit;. ·voluntary                                          or mandatory recall;. ·fines;. ·suspension                                          or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;. ·refusal                                          to permit the import or export of products;. ·product                                          seizure or detentions;. ·injunctions                                          or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and. ·adverse                                          publicity.. If we, our subsidiaries or our respective suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we, our subsidiaries, or our respective collaborators may lose marketing approval for products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.. 28. Internet and internal computer system failures or compromises of our systems or the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and harm our business.. Although a significant portion of our business is conducted using traditional methods of contact and communications such as face-to-face meetings, a portion of our business and the business of our subsidiaries is conducted through the Internet. We could experience system failures and degradations in the future. We also rely on space and office-sharing arrangements that impose additional burdens on our ability to maintain the security of confidential information. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent an extended and/or material system failure or the unintentional disclosure of confidential information if any of the following or similar events occurs:. ·human                                          error;. ·subsystem,                                          component, or software failure;. ·a                                          power or telecommunications failure;. ·an                                          earthquake, fire, or other natural disaster or act of God;. ·hacker                                          attacks or other intentional acts of vandalism; or. ·terrorist                                          acts or war.. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad.. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of how government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action taken by the U.S. presidential administration may impact our business and industry. In particular, the U.S. President has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. Notably, on January 23, 2017, President Trump ordered a civilian hiring freeze for all executive departments and agencies, including the FDA, which prohibits the FDA from filling employee vacancies or creating new positions. Under the terms of the order, the freeze will remain in effect until implementation of a plan to be recommended by the Director for the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) in consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to reduce the size of the federal workforce through attrition. An under-staffed FDA could result in delays in FDA’s responsiveness or in its ability to review submissions or applications, issue regulations or guidance or implement or enforce regulatory requirements in a timely fashion or at all. Moreover, on January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order, applicable to all executive agencies, including the FDA, which requires that for each notice of proposed rulemaking or final regulation to be issued in fiscal year 2017, the agency shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed, unless prohibited by law. These requirements are referred to as the “two-for-one” provisions. This Executive Order includes a budget neutrality provision that requires the total incremental cost of all new regulations in the 2017 fiscal year, including repealed regulations, to be no greater than zero, except in limited circumstances. For fiscal years 2018 and beyond, the Executive Order requires agencies to identify regulations to offset any incremental cost of a new regulation and approximate the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. In interim guidance issued by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB on February 2, 2017, the administration indicates that the “two-for-one” provisions may apply not only to agency regulations, but also to significant agency guidance documents. It is difficult to predict how these requirements will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA’s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.. Risks Relating to our Finances, Capital Requirements and Other Financial Matters. We are an early-stage company with a history of operating losses that is expected to continue, and we are unable to predict the extent of future losses, whether we will generate significant or any revenues or whether we will achieve or sustain profitability.. We are an early-stage company and our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We continue to generate operating losses in all periods including losses from operations of approximately $101.2 million, $65.7 million and $50.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $312.1 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures and incur increasing operating costs and interest expense in the future and our accumulated deficit will increase significantly as we expand development and clinical trial activities for our product candidates and finance investments in certain of our existing and new subsidiaries in accordance with our growth strategy. Our losses have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our working capital, total assets and stockholders’ equity. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with product development and our investments in certain of our subsidiaries, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses, whether we will ever generate significant or any revenues or if we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.. 29. At December 31, 2017, the total amount of debt outstanding was $67.5 million. If we default on our obligations, the holders of our debt may declare the outstanding amounts immediately payable together with accrued interest. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the promissory note with IDB may limit our ability to finance future operations or satisfy capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. It may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.. We may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which may force us to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs, commercialization efforts and planned acquisitions and potentially change our growth strategy.. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $52.5 million, $35.1 million and $29.8 million, respectively. We expect to continue to spend significant amounts on our growth strategy. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months. Until such time, if ever, as we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue and achieve profitability, we expect to seek to finance potential cash needs. Our ability to obtain additional funding when needed, changes to our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our planned R&D activities, expenditures, acquisitions and growth strategy, increased expenses or other events may affect our need for additional capital in the future and require us to seek additional funding sooner than anticipated. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we might have to delay, curtail or eliminate one or more of our R&D programs and commercialization efforts and potentially change our growth strategy.. Raising additional funds by issuing securities or through licensing or lending arrangements may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the share ownership of existing stockholders will be diluted. Any future debt financing may involve covenants that restrict our operations, including limitations on our ability to incur liens or additional debt, pay dividends, redeem our stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions, among other restrictions. In addition, if we raise additional funds through licensing or sublicensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our or our subsidiaries’ product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.. If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors’ views of us and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. To comply with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may need to further upgrade our systems, including information technology, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls exist and go undetected, our financial statements could contain material misstatements that, when discovered in the future could cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations and cause the price of our Common Stock to decline.. 30. Risks Associated with our Capital Stock. Some of our executives, directors and principal stockholders can control our direction and policies, and their interests may be adverse to the interests of our other stockholders.. At December 31, 2017, Lindsay A. Rosenwald, M.D. our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 13.0% of our issued and outstanding capital stock, including 40,000 Series A Preferred Shares. At December 31, 2017, Michael S. Weiss, our Executive Vice Chairman, Strategic Development, beneficially owned 15.2% of our issued and outstanding capital stock. By virtue of their holdings and membership on our Board of Directors, Dr. Rosenwald and Mr. Weiss may individually influence our management and our affairs and may make it difficult for us to consummate corporate transactions such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets that may be favorable from our standpoint or that of our other stockholders.. The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile and may fluctuate in a way that is disproportionate to our operating performance.. Our stock price may experience substantial volatility as a result of a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:. ·announcements                                          we make regarding our or our subsidiaries’ current product candidates, acquisition                                          of potential new product candidates and companies and/or in-licensing through multiple                                          subsidiaries;. ·sales                                          or potential sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock or issuance of debt;. ·our                                          or our subsidiaries’ delay or failure in initiating or completing pre-clinical                                          or clinical trials or unsatisfactory results of any of these trials;. ·announcements                                          about us, our subsidiaries or about our competitors, including clinical trial results,                                          regulatory approvals or new product introductions;. ·developments                                          concerning our or our subsidiaries’ licensors and/or product manufacturers;. ·litigation                                          and other developments relating to our or our subsidiaries’ patents or other proprietary                                          rights or those of our competitors;. ·conditions                                          in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;. ·governmental                                          regulation and legislation;. ·unstable                                          regional political and economic conditions, such as those caused by the U.S. presidential                                          administration change;. ·variations                                          in our anticipated or actual operating results; and. ·change                                          in securities analysts’ estimates of our performance, or our failure to meet analysts’                                          expectations.. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors could reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, may adversely impact the price of our Common Stock.. Almost all of the 50,991,285 million outstanding shares of our Common Stock, inclusive of outstanding equity awards, as of December 31, 2017 are available for sale in the public market, either pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or an effective registration statement. In addition, pursuant to our current shelf registration statement on Form S-3, we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $53.0 million from time to time. Any sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock could cause a drop in the trading price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market.. 31. We and certain of our subsidiaries have never paid and currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the near future except for the dividend we pay on our Preferred A shares. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.. We and certain of our subsidiaries have never paid cash dividends on any of our or their capital stock, or made stock dividends, except for the dividend we pay on our Preferred A shares, and we and many of our subsidiaries currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our businesses, and retain our stock positions. In addition, the terms of existing and future debt agreements may preclude us and certain of our subsidiaries from paying cash of stock dividends. Equally, our subsidiaries are governed by their own boards of directors with individual governance and decision-making regimes and mandates to oversee such subsidiaries in accordance with their respective fiduciary duties. As a result, we alone cannot determine the acts of our subsidiaries that could maximize value to you, such as declaring cash or stock dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:. ·the                                          inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and. ·the                                          ability of our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred                                          stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition                                          or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known                                          as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile                                          acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of                                          Directors.. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition."
