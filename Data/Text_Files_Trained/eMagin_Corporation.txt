[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information included herein as well as the information included in other reports and filings made with the SEC before investing in our common stock.   The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, should they materialize, and you may lose part or all of your investment.. <U+FEFF>. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. We have had losses in the past and may incur losses in the future.. Our accumulated deficit is approximately $227 million as of December 31, 2017. We can give no assurances that we will be profitable in the future. We cannot assure you that if we become profitable that we will be able to sustain profitability or that we will not continue to incur operating losses in the future.. If we are unable to meet our obligations as they become due over the next twelve months, we may not be able to continue our current operations.. Our ability to continue current operations and to execute on our plans is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, raise additional capital or refinance our indebtedness to meet our obligations. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we may have to reduce current operations and delay capital expenditures in order to conserve cash.. Based on our current operating plan, we anticipate that, given our current working capital levels, our current financial projections and our ability to borrow under our working capital facility, we will be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due over the next twelve months. We have no additional committed external sources of funds and additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to take any of these actions or that any effort to sell additional equity securities or borrow additional funds would be successful or would generate sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations, allow us to continue current operations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our existing or future debt agreements. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may need to delay, modify or abandon our current operations and we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures which would likely have a material adverse effect on our product offerings, revenue, results of operations and financial condition.. Our operating results have significant fluctuations.. In addition to the variability resulting from the short - term nature of commitments from our customers, other factors contribute to significant periodic quarterly fluctuations in results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe receipt and timing of orders and the timing of delivery of orders;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability to adjust expense levels or delays in adjusting expense levels, in either case in response to lower than expected revenues or gross margins;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe volume of orders relative to our manufacturing capacity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges due to quarterly fair value adjustments of our warrant liability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct introductions and market acceptance of new products or new generations of products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in cost and availability of labor and components;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct mix;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariation in operating expenses; regulatory requirements and changes in duties and tariffs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpricing and availability of competitive products and services; and. 14.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges, whether or not anticipated, in economic conditions.. Accordingly, the results of any past periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.. We may incur substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.. Our ability to make payments on our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our future operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.. Our ABL Facility contains various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business, which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and taking some corporate actions.. On December 21, 2016 we entered into an asset - based lending agreement with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc., which is referred to herein as the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit or restrict, among other things, our ability to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincur additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake restricted payments (including paying dividends on, redeeming, repurchasing or retiring our capital stock);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tmake investments;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcreate liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsell assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tengage in transactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.. In addition, the ABL Facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, including those described in this \"Risk Factors\" section. A breach of any of the covenants contained in the ABL Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of the documents governing such obligations which would allow the lenders under the ABL Facility to declare all borrowing outstanding to be due and payable. In the event of an acceleration of payment obligations, we would likely be unable to pay our outstanding indebtedness with our cash and cash equivalents then on hand. We could be required to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or terms as favorable as our current agreement or at all. If we are unable to provide alternative means of financing our operations, we may be required to reduce our operations or take other actions that are inconsistent with our current business practices or strategy.. Our debt is variable rate debt, and increases in interest rates could adversely affect us by causing us to incur higher interest costs with respect to such variable rate debt.. The ABL Facility subjects us to interest rate risk. The rate at which we pay interest on amounts borrowed under such facility fluctuates with changes in interest rates. Accordingly, with respect to any amounts from time to time outstanding under the ABL Facility, we are and will be exposed to changes in interest rates. If we are unable to adequately manage our debt structure in response to changes in the market, our interest expense could increase, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. The outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility, net of capitalized debt issuance costs, as of December 31, 2017 were $3.8 million.. 15. Risks Related To Manufacturing. The manufacture of active matrix OLED microdisplays encompasses several complex processes resulting in irregular production schedules, including production delays and interruptions, which could adversely affect our operating results.. Our product technology and manufacturing processes are evolving which can result in production challenges and difficulties. We cannot assure you that we will be able to produce our products in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems which could result in delays in delivery of orders or product introductions.. Several steps of our production processes are dependent upon certain critical machines and tools which could result in delivery interruptions and foregone revenues.. We currently have little equipment redundancy in our manufacturing facility. If we experience any significant disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facility or a serious failure of a critical piece of equipment, we may be unable to supply microdisplays to our customers in a timely manner. Interruptions in our manufacturing could be caused by equipment problems, the introduction of new equipment into the manufacturing process or delays in the delivery of new manufacturing equipment. Lead - time for delivery, installation, testing, repair and maintenance of manufacturing equipment can be extensive. We have experienced production interruptions in the past and no assurance can be given that we will not lose potential sales or be unable to meet production orders due to future production interruptions in our manufacturing line.. We rely on key sole source and limited source suppliers.. We depend on a number of sole source or limited source suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and services. These include silicon wafers, circuit boards, graphic integrated circuits, passive components, materials and chemicals, and equipment support. We maintain several single - source supplier relationships either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations (or a combination thereof). Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We do not manufacture the silicon integrated circuits on which we incorporate our OLED technology. Instead, we provide the design layouts to semiconductor contract manufacturers who manufactures the integrated circuits on silicon wafers. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials or services on a timely basis could result in manufacturing delays, increased costs and ultimately in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Generally, we do not have long - term contracts or written agreements with our source suppliers but instead operate on the basis of short term purchase orders.. Our results of operations, financial condition and business would be harmed if we were unable to balance customer demand and capacity.. As customer demand for our products changes, and as we enter new markets which may require higher volume mass production, we must be able to ramp up or adjust our production capacity to meet demand or enter into relationships with high volume manufacturers.  We are continually taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity needs for our products. If we are not able to expand our manufacturing capacity or enter into relationships with high volume manufacturers, our prospects may be limited and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. If we experience delays or unforeseen costs associated with adjusting our capacity levels, we may not be able to achieve our financial targets. For some of our products, vendor lead times exceed our customers' required delivery time, causing us to order to forecast rather than order based on actual demand. Ordering raw material, building finished goods, and scheduling contract manufacturer production for our consumer products based on forecasts exposes us to numerous risks, including potential inability to service customer demand within an acceptable timeframe, holding excess inventory or having unabsorbed manufacturing overhead.. Variations in our production yields impact our ability to reduce our costs and could cause our margins to decline and our operating results to suffer.. All of our products are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex. The number of usable items, or yield, from our production processes may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including but not limited to the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariability in our manufacturing process and repeatability;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in manufacturing personnel due to turnover or employee absences;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontamination of the manufacturing environment or equipment;. 16.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tequipment failure, power outages, or modification to our manufacturing processes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts and other raw materials;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdefects in packaging either within or without our control;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tany transitions or changes in our production process, planned or unplanned; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcertain customer requirements outside of our normal specifications.. Variations in our production yields impacts our costs and could cause our margins to decline and our operating results to suffer.. We could experience manufacturing interruptions, delays, or inefficiencies if we are unable to timely and reliably procure components from single - sourced suppliers.. We maintain several single - source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations (or a combination thereof). If the supply of a critical single - source material or component is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which would harm our operating results. Further, we utilize single source contract manufacturers to assemble our night vision consumer products. Inadequate line capacity or production capacity commitments to other products could affect our ability to build sufficient quantities of products to meet demand.. Risks Related To Our Intellectual Property. We may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights.. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secret protection, licensing agreements and other arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary technologies. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Patents may not be issued for our current patent applications; third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent any patent issued to us; unauthorized parties could obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights; rights granted under patents issued to us may not afford us any competitive advantage; others may independently develop similar technology or design around our patents; and protection of our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign countries. On April 30, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc., mandated a more expansive and flexible approach towards a determination as to whether a patent is obvious and invalid, which may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure or maintain existing patents. Any future infringement or other claims or prosecutions we may bring against third parties based on our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such claims could be time consuming to assert, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, or result in our entering into royalty or licensing agreements. Protection of intellectual property has historically been a large yearly expense for us. For a period prior to 2008, we were not in a financial position to properly protect all of our intellectual property, and may not be in a position to properly protect our position or stay ahead of competition in new research and the protecting of the resulting intellectual property.  Some of our commercial agreements may limit our ability to enforce certain of our intellectual property rights against certain parties.. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and other non - patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities. We try to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy, including requiring employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements. We cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached. We also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets or that our trade secrets and proprietary know - how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.. Third parties may assert claims against us which could harm our business.. We may face third party claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and others that our business practices or products infringe adversely held intellectual property rights. We may face third party claims that our employees or contractors have misappropriated and unlawfully disclosed to us for our benefit third party trade secrets or other proprietary information. Furthermore, we have agreed to indemnify customers, licensees and partners for certain intellectual property claims brought against them. Defending any such claims, whether or not meritorious, would cause us to incur costs and may divert the attention of management and technical personnel. Resolution of any such claims by litigation or settlement may entail payment of damages, entry into license agreements, changes to our business practices or products, and changes in our relationships with our customers, employees, licensees, partners or contractors.. 17. Risks Related To The Microdisplay Industry. The success of the commercial and consumer microdisplay industry is dependent upon widespread acceptance of microdisplay systems products, including their incorporation into AR and VR systems and products.. The market for microdisplays is still emerging. Our long - term success will depend on widespread consumer acceptance of microdisplays as well as the success of the commercialization of the microdisplay market for consumer applications. As an OEM supplier, our customers' products must also be well accepted. At present, it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities for our technology in this market.. Procurement of microdisplays for military systems is subject to changes in federal budget priorities and if government funding is discontinued or reduced, our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited and our business results, operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.. Historically, a large portion of our revenue is from military contracts. Procurement of microdisplays for military systems is subject to changes in federal budget priorities. Government programs are subject to authorization, appropriation and allocation of funding on an annual basis. Additionally, funding can be shifted to other programs if the government changes budget priorities, such as in a time of war or for other reasons. Government contracts are also subject to the risk that the government may not appropriate and allocate all funding contemplated by the contract. Government contracts generally permit the contracting authority to terminate the contract for the convenience of the government and in the event of a premature termination of a contract, the full value of such contract will not be realized.. The research and development and product procurement contracts of the customers we supply may be similarly impacted by government budget decisions. If the government funding is discontinued or reduced, our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited and our business results, operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.. In addition, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business under our federal government contracts, including in our role as a subcontractor. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non - compliance may lead to the assessment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages or the loss of business.. The microdisplay market is highly competitive with several competing technologies.. We do business in intensely competitive markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in market requirements and competition from both other suppliers and our potential OEM customers. Such markets are typically characterized by price erosion. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. We expect these factors to include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour success in designing, manufacturing and delivering expected new products, including those implementing new technologies on a timely basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to address the needs of our customers;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use and pricing of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsuccessful expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour efficiency of production, and ability to manufacture and ship products on time;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe rate at which OEM customers incorporate our product solutions into their own products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe market acceptance of our customers' products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct or technology introductions by our competitors.. In addition, our customers may be reluctant to rely on a relatively small company such as eMagin for a critical component. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.. 18. The display industry may be subject to cyclical demand and overcapacity.. Our business strategy is dependent on OEM manufacturers' building and selling products that incorporate our OLED displays as components into those products. Industry - wide fluctuations in demand could cause significant harm to our business. The OLED microdisplay sector may experience overcapacity if additional capacity comes on line which could lead to pricing pressures and a difficult market in which to sell our products.. Our competitors have many advantages over us.. As the microdisplay market develops, we expect to experience intense competition from numerous domestic and foreign companies, including well - established corporations possessing worldwide manufacturing and production facilities, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us, as well as from emerging companies who may be subsidized by their governments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.. Our products are subject to lengthy OEM development periods.. We sell most of our microdisplays to OEMs who will incorporate them into products they sell. OEMs determine during their product development phase whether they will incorporate our products. The time elapsed between initial sampling of our products by OEMs, the custom design of our products to meet specific OEM product requirements, and the ultimate incorporation of our products into OEM consumer products is significant, often with a duration of between one and three years. If our products fail to meet our OEM customers' cost, performance or technical requirements or if unexpected technical challenges arise in the integration of our products into OEM consumer products, our operating results could be significantly and adversely affected. Long delays in achieving customer qualification and incorporation of our products also could adversely affect our business.. In order to increase or maintain our profit margins we may have to continuously develop new products, product enhancements and new technologies.. In some markets, prices of established products tend to decline over time. In order to increase or maintain our profit margins over the long - term, we believe that we will need to continuously develop new products, product enhancements and new technologies that will either slow price declines of our products or reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products. While we anticipate many opportunities to reduce production costs over time, there can be no assurance that these cost reduction plans will be successful, that we will have the resources to fund the expenditures necessary to implement certain cost - saving measures, or that our costs can be reduced as quickly as any reduction in unit prices. We may also attempt to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling price by introducing new products with higher selling prices that may or may not offset price declines in more mature products. If we fail to do so successfully, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.. Risks Related To The Consumer Night Vision Products Industry. The commercial success of the consumer night vision industry depends on the widespread market acceptance of consumer night vision products.. The commercial market, if any, for consumer night vision products is still emerging. The success of our BlazeTorch and BlazeSpark night vision products may depend on the consumer acceptance of these products as well as the success of the commercialization of the night vision market. The existing nonmilitary night vision market is more narrowly focused on tactical, hunting, law enforcement and first responder markets. In order to achieve the sales levels necessary to achieve our plans in this area, we need to expand beyond these existing markets into broader based consumer acceptance, including hobbyists, outdoor sports enthusiasts, and social media users interested in capturing nighttime activities, who may not exist in sufficient numbers to make the consumer market viable for us.. The Company has limited experience in the consumer electronics industry and this is a highly competitive industry.. With the introduction of the consumer night vision products, we are seeking to do business in intensely competitive consumer - focused markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in market requirements, price erosion and competition from other manufacturers and distributors. This intense competition is likely to result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. We expect these factors to include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour success in designing, manufacturing and delivering expected new products, including those implementing new technologies on a timely basis;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to address the needs of our customers and the quality of our customer services;. 19.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to effectively market and advertise our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use and pricing of our products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability to market successfully to law enforcement, utility and first responder customers.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe capacity of our outsourced production facilities, and ability to manufacture and ship products on time;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to comply with country specific regulatory certifications for consumer products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tproduct or technology introductions by our competitors.. Risks Related To Our Business. Our success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified technical and consulting personnel.. We must hire highly skilled technical personnel as employees and as independent contractors in order to develop our products. The competition for skilled technical employees is intense and we may not be able to retain or recruit such personnel. We must compete with companies that possess greater financial and other resources than we do, and that may be more attractive to potential employees and contractors. To be competitive, we may have to increase the compensation, including salaries, bonuses, stock options and other fringe benefits, offered to employees in order to attract and retain such personnel. The costs of attracting and retaining new personnel may have a materially adverse effect on our business and our operating results.. Our success depends in a large part on the continuing service of key personnel.. Changes in management could have an adverse effect on our business. We are dependent upon the active participation of several key management personnel and will also need to recruit additional management in order to expand according to our business plan. The failure to attract and retain additional management or personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance.. Our operating results are substantially dependent on the development and acceptance of new products and technology innovations.. Our future success may depend on our ability to develop new and lower cost solutions for existing and new markets and for customers to accept those solutions. We must introduce new products in a timely and cost - efficient manner, and we must secure production orders for those products from our customers. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we historically have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Some or all of those technologies or products may not successfully make the transition from the research and development phase. Even when we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular product or technology, it may fail to gain market acceptance. The successful development and introduction of these products depends on a number of factors, including the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tachievement of technology advances required to make commercially viable devices;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe accuracy of our predictions of market requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of our new product designs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of new technology in certain markets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of qualified research and development and product development personnel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour timely completion of product designs and development;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability and available resources to expand sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to develop repeatable processes to manufacture new products in sufficient quantities and at low enough costs for commercial sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour customers' ability to develop competitive products incorporating our products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tacceptance of our customers' products by the market.. 20. If any of these or other factors become problematic, we may not be able to develop and introduce these new products in a timely or cost - effective manner.. If government agencies or companies discontinue or curtail their funding for our research and development programs, our business may suffer.. Changes in federal budget priorities could adversely affect our contract and display product revenue. Historically, U.S. government agencies have funded a significant part of our research and development activities. Our funding has the risk of being redirected to other programs when the government changes budget priorities, such as in time of war or for other reasons. Government contracts are also subject to the risk that the government agency may not appropriate and allocate all funding contemplated by the contract. In addition our government contracts generally permit the contracting authority to terminate the contract for the convenience of the government. The full value of the contracts would not be realized if they were prematurely terminated. We may be unable to incur sufficient allowable costs to generate the full estimated contract values. Furthermore, the research and development and product procurement contracts of the customers we supply may be similarly impacted. If the government funding is discontinued or reduced, our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited and our business results or operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.. Our business depends on new products and technologies.. The market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in product, design and manufacturing process technologies. Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop and manufacture new products and technologies to match the varying requirements of different customers in order to establish a competitive position and become profitable. Furthermore, we must adapt our products and processes to technological changes and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost - effective and timely basis. Our failure to accomplish any of the above could harm our business and operating results.. We generally do not have long - term contracts with our customers.. Our business has primarily operated on the basis of short - term purchase orders. We receive some longer term purchase agreements and procurement contracts, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to do so. Our current purchase agreements, depending on the circumstances, can be cancelled or revised without penalty. We plan production primarily on the basis of internally generated forecasts of demand based on communications with customers, and available industry data which makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenues. If we fail to accurately forecast operating results, our business may suffer and the market price of our shares may decline.. Our business strategy may fail if we cannot continue to form strategic relationships with companies that manufacture and use products that could incorporate our active matrix OLED technology.. Our prospects could be significantly affected by our ability to develop strategic alliances with high volume manufacturers and with OEMs for incorporation of our active matrix OLED microdisplay technology into their products. While we intend to continue to establish strategic relationships with manufacturers of electronic consumer products, personal computers, chipmakers, lens makers, equipment makers, material suppliers and/or systems assemblers, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish and maintain strategic relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or that the alliances we do enter into will realize their objectives. Failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect on our business.. Our business depends to some extent on international transactions.. We purchase needed materials and subcontract manufacturing processes from companies located abroad and may be adversely affected by political and currency risk, as well as the additional costs of doing business with foreign entities. Some customers in other countries have longer receivable periods as is customary in those countries. In addition, many of the foreign OEMs that are the most likely long - term purchasers of our microdisplays expose us to additional political and currency risk. We may find it necessary to locate manufacturing facilities abroad to be closer to our customers which could expose us to various risks, including management of a multi - national organization, the complexities of complying with foreign laws and customs, political instability and the complexities of taxation in multiple jurisdictions.. Our business may expose us to product liability claims.. Our business may expose us to potential product liability claims. Although no such claims have been brought against us to date, and to our knowledge no such claim is threatened or likely, we may face liability to product users for damages resulting from the faulty design or manufacture of our products. While we plan to maintain product liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not exceed coverage limits, fall outside the scope of such coverage, or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates, if at all.. 21. Our business is subject to environmental regulations and possible liability arising from potential employee claims of exposure to harmful substances used in the development and manufacture of our products.. We are subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, experimental and other hazardous chemicals used in our design and manufacturing process. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations. Compliance with these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. We develop, evaluate and utilize new chemical compounds in the manufacture of our products. While we attempt to ensure that our employees are protected from exposure to hazardous materials, we cannot assure you that potentially harmful exposure will not occur or that we will not be liable to employees as a result.. Provisions in certain of our commercial agreements and our military business may prevent or delay an acquisition of, partnership with, or investment in our Company, and our ability to develop OEM and mass production partnerships, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.. Provisions in certain of our commercial agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, as a contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. federal government, we are subject to and must comply with various government regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and the internal organization and operation of our business. As a result, these provisions and business may prevent or delay an acquisition of, partnership with, or investment in, our Company and our ability to develop OEM and mass production partnerships and could limit the price that strategic investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential partners or acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.. Some of our business is subject to U.S. government procurement laws and regulations.. We must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business under our federal government contracts, including the business that we do as a subcontractor. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non - compliance may lead to the assessment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages, or the loss of business.. Our international sales and operations are subject to export laws and regulations.. We must comply with all applicable export control laws, including the EAR and ITAR. Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR or by the U.S. State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) under the ITAR. We believe certain of our products will be classified as defense articles and licenses from the DDTC will be required for exports. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.. Economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.. Economic conditions and market instability may affect our customers and suppliers. Any adverse financial or economic impact to our customers may impact their ability to pay timely, or result in their inability to pay. It may also impact their ability to fund future purchases, or increase the sales cycles which could lead to a reduction in revenue and accounts receivable. Our suppliers may increase their prices or may be unable to supply needed raw materials on a timely basis which could result in our inability to meet customers' demand or affect our gross margins. Our suppliers may also impose more stringent payment terms on us. The timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and financial markets remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future or that our results will not be materially and adversely affected.. We may be affected by recent tax legislation.. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law an extensive overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Legislation. The Tax Legislation makes significant changes to the taxation of individuals and corporations, which could significantly affect our business, our operations, our financial condition, or the taxation of our stockholders and warrant holders. Potential investors should consult their tax advisors about the Tax Legislation and its potential impact on making an investment in the Company.. 22. Risks Related To Our Stock. The market price of our common stock may be volatile.. The market price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations. During our four most recently completed fiscal quarters, the closing price of our stock ranged from a high of $2.85 in January 2017 to a low of $1.55 in December 2017. The market price of our common stock in the future is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our operating results and financial conditions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations, commercial partnerships, new product developments, or design wins by us or our competitors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral conditions in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide economic and financial conditions.. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. The broad market fluctuations and other factors may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market conditions affecting the stock markets in general, including price and trading fluctuations on the NYSE American.. Market conditions may result in volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case being unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. Concerns over global stability and economic conditions in the United States and abroad have contributed to the extreme volatility of the markets which may have an effect on the market price of our common stock.. Future issuances of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute the interests of existing stockholders.. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, including shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures that we believe will allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share in our current markets and expand into adjacent markets, broaden our technology and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with distributors and OEMs. Any future issuances of shares of our common stock, including in connection with any future acquisition, partnership or joint venture, may result in the dilution of existing stockholders to the extent we are required to issue equity securities.. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.. Concentration of ownership of our stock may enable one stockholder or a small number of stockholders to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval.. As of December 31, 2017, Stillwater Holdings LLC (f/k/a Stillwater LLC) owned approximately 16% of our outstanding voting stock, Flat Creek Fiduciary Management, as trustee of a trust which the sole member of Stillwater Holdings LLC has investment control, owned approximately 10% of our outstanding voting stock, Stillwater Trust LLC owned 5% of our outstanding voting stock and the sole member of Stillwater Holdings LLC is the investment manager of Rainbow Gate Corporation, which owned approximately 4% of our outstanding voting stock. Together such stockholders owned approximately 35% of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, may be able to exert a significant degree of influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Further, if these stockholders act together with another stockholder, Ginola Limited, which has common directors with Mount Union Corp., Chelsea Trust Company and Crestflower Corporation, as of December 31, 2017, they would collectively have represented approximately 40% of our outstanding voting stock. This concentration of ownership may facilitate or hinder a change of control and might affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. Nevertheless, the ability to influence the election of our Board of Directors or otherwise have influence does not modify the fiduciary duties of our Board of Directors to represent the interests of all stockholders.. 23. We do not intend to pay cash dividends. We last paid a dividend on our capital stock in 2012 and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our securities will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.. We have not paid dividends on any of our capital stock since 2012. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, our ABL Facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our securities if the price of our common stock increases.. A provision in our certificate of incorporation and by - laws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our Company, which could decrease the market value of our common stock.. Provisions of Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation and our by - laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our Board of Directors. These provisions include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimitations on the removal of directors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our by - laws; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our Board of Directors may determine.. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock that our Board of Directors has not approved. These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation. These provisions may apply even if some stockholders may consider the transaction beneficial to them. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock.. We are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.. As a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we could remediate any such weakness; our failure to do so would prevent our management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year is effective. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.. <U+FEFF>. <U+FEFF>. 24"
