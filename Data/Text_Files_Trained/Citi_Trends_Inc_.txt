[1] "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we deem to be currently immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond rapidly to changes in consumers' fashion tastes, and our failure to adequately evaluate fashion trends could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The apparel industry in general and our core customer market in particular are subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends and shifting consumer demands. Accordingly, our success is heavily dependent on our ability to anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging fashion trends, including products, styles and materials that will appeal to our target consumers. A failure on our part to anticipate, identify or react appropriately and timely to changes in styles, trends, brand preferences or desired image preferences is likely to lead to lower demand for our merchandise, which could cause, among other things, sales declines, excess inventories and higher markdowns.. If we are unsuccessful in competing with our retail apparel competitors, our market share could decline or our growth could be impaired and, as a result, our financial results could suffer.. The retail apparel market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national off-price apparel chains such as TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Cato, and Burlington; mass merchants such as Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart; smaller discount retail chains that sell only women's products, such as Rainbow; and general merchandise discount stores and dollar stores, which offer a variety of products, including apparel, for the value-conscious consumer. We also compete against local off-price and specialty retail stores, regional retail chains, traditional department stores, web-based retail stores and other direct retailers.. The level of competition we face from these retailers varies depending on the product segment, as many of our competitors do not offer apparel for the entire family. Our greatest competition is generally in women's apparel. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources than we do and, as a result, may be able to adapt better to changing market conditions, exploit new opportunities and exert greater pricing pressures on suppliers than we can. Many of these retailers have better name recognition among consumers than we do and purchase significantly more merchandise from vendors. These retailers may be able to purchase merchandise that we cannot purchase because of their name recognition and relationships with suppliers, or they may be able to purchase merchandise with better pricing concessions than we can. Our local and regional competitors have extensive knowledge of the consumer base and may be able to garner more loyalty from customers than we can. If the consumer base we serve is satisfied with the selection, quality and price of our competitors' products, consumers may decide not to shop in our stores. Additionally, if our existing competitors or other retailers decide to focus more on our core customers, we may have greater difficulty in competing effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could suffer.. Our ability to attract consumers to our stores depends on the success of the strip shopping centers where our stores are located.. We locate our stores primarily in strip shopping centers where we believe our consumers and potential consumers shop. The success of an individual store can depend on favorable placement within a given strip shopping center. We cannot control the development of alternative shopping destinations near our existing stores or the availability or cost of real estate within existing or new shopping destinations. If our store locations fail to attract sufficient consumer traffic or we are unable to locate replacement locations on terms acceptable to us, our business could suffer. If one or more of the anchor tenants located in the strip shopping centers where our stores. 8. Table of Contents. are located close or leave, or if there is significant deterioration of the surrounding areas in which our stores are located, our business may be adversely affected.. We could experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to fulfill our current and future merchandising needs.. We depend on our suppliers for the continued availability and satisfactory quality of our merchandise. Most of our suppliers could discontinue selling to us at any time. Additionally, if the manufacturers or other owners of brands or trademarks terminate the license agreements under which some of our suppliers sell our products, we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise of comparable fashion appeal or quality, in the same quantities or at the same prices. In addition, a number of our suppliers are smaller, less capitalized companies and are more likely to be impacted by unfavorable general economic and market conditions than larger and better capitalized companies. These smaller suppliers may not have sufficient liquidity during economic downturns to properly fund their businesses, and their ability to supply their products to us could be negatively impacted. If we lose the services of one or more of our significant suppliers or one or more of them fail to meet our merchandising needs, we may be unable to obtain replacement merchandise in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.. Our sales could decline as a result of general economic and other factors outside of our control, such as changes in consumer spending patterns and declines in employment levels.. Downturns, or the expectation of a downturn, in general economic conditions, including the effects of unemployment levels, interest rates, levels of consumer debt, inflation in food and energy prices, taxation, government stimulus, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors, could adversely affect consumer spending patterns, our sales and our results of operations. Consumer confidence may also be affected by domestic and international political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters or other significant events outside of our control, any of which could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. Because apparel generally is a discretionary purchase, declines in consumer spending patterns may have a more negative effect on apparel retailers than some other retailers. In addition, since many of our stores are located in the southeastern United States, our operations are more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of our more geographically diversified competitors. Therefore, any adverse economic conditions that have a disproportionate effect on the southeastern United States could have a greater negative effect on our sales and results of operations than on retailers with a more geographically diversified store base.. We do not sell our products through the internet. As the retail industry experiences an increase in online sales, our sales could be adversely affected.. The retail landscape is changing with consumers' shopping habits shifting away from the traditional brick-and-mortar stores to online retailers. Internet sales have been obtaining an increasing percentage of retail sales over the past few years and this trend is expected to continue. Although we have tested the sale of products through the internet, we no longer have any items available on our company's website.  The continued growth of online sales could have a negative impact on our sales, as our customers may decide to make purchases through online retailers.. Adverse trade restrictions may disrupt our supply of merchandise. We also face various risks because much of our merchandise is imported from abroad.. We purchase the products we sell directly from approximately 1,800 vendors, and a substantial portion of this merchandise is manufactured outside of the United States and imported by our vendors from countries such as China and other areas of the Far East. The countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future could become subject to new trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments. There is increased uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the United States and other countries. Trade restrictions, including increased customs restrictions and tariffs or quotas against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply or impede the timely delivery of apparel available to us and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, our merchandise supply could be impacted if our vendors' imports become subject to existing or future duties and quotas, or if our vendors face increased competition from other companies for production facilities, import quota capacity and shipping capacity.. We also face a variety of other risks generally associated with relying on vendors that do business in foreign markets and import merchandise from abroad, such as:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical instability, natural disasters, or the threat of terrorism, in particular in countries where our vendors source merchandise;. 9. Table of Contents. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in merchandise costs due to raw material price inflation or changes in purchasing power caused by fluctuations in currency exchange rates;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenhanced security measures at United States and foreign ports, which could delay delivery of imports;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timposition of new or supplemental duties, taxes, and other charges on imports;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelayed receipt or non-delivery of goods due to the failure of foreign-source suppliers to comply with import regulations, organized labor strikes or congestion at United States ports; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor and environmental standards.. As an apparel retailer, we rely on numerous third parties in the supply chain to produce and deliver the products that we sell, and our business may be negatively impacted by their failure to comply with applicable law.. We rely on numerous third parties to supply the products that we sell. Violations of law by our importers, manufacturers or distributors could result in delays in shipments and receipt of goods or damage our reputation, thus causing our sales to decline. In addition, merchandise we sell in our stores is subject to regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities with respect to quality and safety. Regulations in this area may change from time to time. Issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell in our stores, regardless of our fault, or customer concerns about such issues, could result in damage to our reputation, lost sales, uninsured product liability claims or losses, merchandise recalls and increased costs. Further, we are susceptible to the receipt of counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods. We could incur liability with manufacturers or other owners of the brands or trademarked products if we receive and sell counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods, even inadvertently, and, therefore, it is important that we establish relationships with reputable vendors to reduce the risk that we may inadvertently receive counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods. Although we have a quality assurance team to check merchandise in an effort to assure that we purchase only authentic brands and licensed goods and are careful in selecting our vendors, we may receive products that we are prohibited from selling or incur liability for selling counterfeit brands or unlicensed goods, which could adversely impact our results of operations.. A significant disruption to our distribution process or southeastern retail locations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our ability to distribute our merchandise to our store locations in a timely manner is essential to the efficient and profitable operation of our business. We have distribution centers located in Darlington, South Carolina and Roland, Oklahoma. Any natural disaster or other disruption to the operation of either of these facilities due to fire, accidents, weather conditions or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory and impair our ability to stock our stores adequately.. In addition, the southeastern United States, where the Darlington distribution center and many of our stores are located, is vulnerable to significant damage or destruction from hurricanes and tropical storms. Although we maintain insurance on our stores and other facilities, the economic effects of a natural disaster that affects our distribution centers and/or a significant number of our stores could increase our operating expenses, impair our cash flows and reduce our sales.. If we fail to protect our name and brand in the marketplace, there could be a negative effect on our business and limitations on our ability to penetrate new markets.. We believe that our \"Citi Trends\" trademark is integral to our store design and our success in building consumer loyalty to our brand. We have registered this trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We have also registered, or applied for registration of, additional trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that we believe are important to our business. We cannot assure you that these registrations will prevent imitation of our name, merchandising concept, store design or private label merchandise or the infringement of our other intellectual property rights by others. Imitation of our name, concept, store design or merchandise in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation of our brand image could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not try to block the manufacture or sale of our private label merchandise by claiming that our merchandise violates their trademarks or other proprietary rights since other entities may have rights to trademarks that contain the word \"Citi\" or may have rights in similar or competing marks for apparel and/or accessories. Although we cannot. 10. Table of Contents. currently estimate the likelihood of success of any such lawsuit or ultimate resolution of such a conflict, such a controversy could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls in our business, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.. Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and an audit of such controls by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition and accounting for inventory/cost of sales, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in our effort to prevent financial fraud. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business.. Failure to attract, train, assimilate and retain skilled personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.. Like most retailers, we experience significant employee turnover rates, particularly among store sales associates and managers. We therefore must continually attract, hire and train new personnel to meet our staffing needs. We constantly compete for qualified personnel with companies in our industry and in other industries. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our recruiting and training costs and could cause us to be unable to service our customers effectively, thus reducing our ability to operate our stores as profitably as we have in the past.. In addition, we rely heavily on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and other key management associates, and accordingly, the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and results of operations.. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of a proxy fight and the actions of activist shareholders.. If we become engaged in a proxy contest with activist shareholders in the future, our business could be adversely affected because:. <U+F0B7>        Responding to proxy contests, litigation and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees.. <U+F0B7>        Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and harm our ability to attract new investors and to retain and attract experienced executives and employees.. <U+F0B7>        If individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract experienced executives and employees, to effectively and timely implement our business strategy and create additional value for stockholders.. <U+F0B7>        We may experience a significant increase in legal fees, administrative, advisor and associated costs incurred in connection with responding to a proxy contest or related action. For example, we incurred $2.5 million in expenses as a result of the proxy contest in connection with our 2017 annual meeting.. These factors could adversely impact our results of operations and could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.. Increases in the minimum wage could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Wage rates for many of our employees are slightly above the federal minimum wage. As federal and/or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only our employees' wage rates that are under the new minimum, but also the wages paid to our other hourly employees. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.. Failure to comply with legal requirements could result in increased costs.. Compliance risks in our business include areas such as employment law, taxation, customer relations and personal injury claims, among others.  Failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations could result in unexpected costs and have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.. 11. Table of Contents. Changes in government regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.. Our business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. New legal requirements in any number of areas could result in higher compliance costs. Changes in areas, such as workplace-regulation and other employment-related laws, supply chain, privacy and information security, or environmental regulation may require extensive structural and organizational changes that could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business, cause reputational harm and materially adversely affect our operations and financial results.. Any failure of our management information systems or the inability of third parties to continue to upgrade and maintain our systems could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We depend on the accuracy, reliability and proper functioning of our management information systems, including the systems used to track our sales and facilitate inventory management. We also rely on our management information systems for merchandise planning, replenishment and markdowns, as well as other key business functions. These functions enhance our ability to optimize sales while limiting markdowns and reducing inventory risk through properly marking down slow-selling styles, reordering existing styles and effectively distributing new inventory to our stores. We do not currently have redundant systems for all functions performed by our management information systems. Any interruption in these systems could impair our ability to manage our inventory effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business.. We depend on third-party suppliers to maintain and periodically upgrade our management information systems.  If any of these suppliers is unable to continue to maintain and upgrade these software programs and/or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, it could result in an adverse effect on our business.. Failure to secure our customers' charge card information, or the private data relating to our associates or the Company, could subject us to negative publicity, government enforcement actions, or private litigation.. We have procedures and technology in place to safeguard our customers' debit and credit card information, our associates' private data, and the Company's records and intellectual property.  However, if we experience a data security breach, we could be exposed to costly negative publicity, governmental enforcement actions, and private litigation.  In addition, our sales could be negatively impacted if our customers have security concerns and are not willing to purchase our merchandise using charge cards.. Our sales, inventory levels and earnings fluctuate on a seasonal basis, which makes our business more susceptible to adverse events that occur during the first and fourth quarters.. Our sales and earnings are significantly higher during the first and fourth quarters each year due to the importance of the spring selling season, which includes Easter, and the fall selling season, which includes Christmas. Factors negatively affecting us during the first and fourth quarters, including adverse weather, unfavorable economic conditions, reduced governmental assistance, and tax refund patterns for our customers, will have a greater adverse effect on our financial condition than if our business was less seasonal.. In order to prepare for the spring and fall selling seasons, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than during other parts of the year. This seasonality makes our business more susceptible to the risk that our inventory will not satisfy actual consumer demand. In addition, any unanticipated demand imbalances during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown or fail to satisfy our consumers. In either event, our sales may be lower and our cost of sales may be higher than historical levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. We experience fluctuations and variability in our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations and, as a result, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.. Our comparable store sales and quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past based on a number of economic, seasonal and competitive factors, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Since the beginning of fiscal 2010, our quarter-to-quarter comparable store sales have ranged from a decrease of 11.9% to an increase of 13.9%.  This variability could cause our comparable store sales and quarterly results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.. 12. Table of Contents. Our stock price is subject to volatility.. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may be influenced in the future by a number of factors, including:. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in securities analysts' recommendations or estimates of our financial performance;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market valuations or operating performance of our competitors or companies similar to ours;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tannouncements by us, our competitors or other retailers;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadditions and departures of key personnel;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in accounting principles;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe passage of legislation or other developments affecting us;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe trading volume of our common stock in the public market;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in economic or financial market conditions;. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnatural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war or periods of civil unrest; and. · \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe realization of some or all of the risks described in this section entitled \"Risk Factors.\". In addition, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations from time to time, and the market prices of the equity securities of retailers have been extremely volatile and have recently experienced sharp price and trading volume changes. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.. We cannot provide any guaranty of future cash dividend payments or that we will continue to actively repurchase our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase program.. Any determination to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future (quarterly or otherwise) will be based, among other things, upon our financial condition, results of operations, business and cash requirements and our board of directors' conclusion in each instance that the declaration and payment of a cash dividend is in the best interest of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend.  In addition, there can be no assurance that our existing share repurchase authorization will be completed.. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated by-laws, as amended, contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, a classified board of directors, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at stockholder meetings and \"blank check\" preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our board of directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the common stock.. We are also subject to several provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock or may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.. 13.
