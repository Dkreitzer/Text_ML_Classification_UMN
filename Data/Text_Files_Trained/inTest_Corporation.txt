[1] "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS. The following are some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our future performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us and we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business. However, these risks and uncertainties are the most significant factors that we have identified at this time. If one or more of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could suffer, and the price of our stock could be negatively affected.    We seek to acquire additional businesses. If we are unable to do so, our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited. We may incur significant expenses related to due diligence or other transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that may not be completed.    A key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. We seek to make acquisitions that will further expand our product lines as well as reduce our overall reliance on the ATE market. We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if:. <U+25CF> \t\t\twe are unable to identify suitable businesses, technologies or products to acquire; \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe do not have sufficient cash or access to required capital at the necessary time;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are unwilling or unable to outbid larger, more resourceful companies; or. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe are unable to successfully close proposed acquisitions.. Our acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our results in the future.    If we acquire additional businesses, technologies or products, we will face the following additional risks:. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfuture acquisitions could divert management's attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management, operational and financial resources;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\twe may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire.. If any of the events described above occur, our earnings could be reduced. If we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions, we would dilute our existing stockholders' interests and our earnings per share may decrease. If we issue debt in connection with any future acquisitions, lenders may require that we pledge our assets to secure repayment of such debt and impose covenants on us which could, among other things, restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses.    Our business is subject to intense competition, which has in the past and could in the future, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We face significant competition throughout the world in each of our product segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do. Some of our competitors are much smaller than we are, and therefore have much lower levels of overhead than we do, which enables them to sell their competing products at lower prices. In order to remain competitive, we must be able to continually commit a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or technologies. Over the last several years, in response to significant declines in global demand for our products, some competitors have reduced their product pricing significantly, which has led to intensified price based competition, which has and could continue to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. - 13 -. Table of Contents. Our sales are affected by the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly.    Our business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Capital expenditures by these companies depend upon, among other things, the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downturn. Conversely, semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products. In addition to being cyclical, the ATE market has also developed a seasonal pattern in the last several years, with the second and third quarters being the periods of strong demand and the first and fourth quarters being periods of weakened demand. We believe this change has been driven by the strong demand for consumer products containing semiconductor content sold during the year-end holiday shopping season. These market changes and seasonal sales pattern have contributed in the past, and will likely continue to contribute in the future, to fluctuations in our operating results.    We seek to further diversify the markets for our thermal products in order to increase the proportion of our sales attributable to markets which are less subject to cyclicality than the semiconductor and ATE markets. If we are unable to do so, our future performance will remain substantially exposed to the fluctuations of the cyclicality of the semiconductor and ATE markets.     Since 2009, we have sold our thermal products in markets outside of the semiconductor market, including the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunications markets. During 2017 and 2016, our sales to these non-semiconductor markets were $29.0 million (including $13.2 million of net revenues attributable to Ambrell) and $12.2 million, respectively, and represented 44% and 30% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Prior to our acquisition of Ambrell, we offered only highly specialized engineering solutions in these markets outside the semiconductor market, the demand for which is limited and which we expect may vary significantly from period to period. Our goal is to increase our sales into these and other non-semiconductor markets; however, in most cases, the expansion of our thermal product sales into these new markets has occurred in the last several years, and we may experience difficulty in expanding our sales efforts further into these markets. These difficulties could include hiring sales and marketing staff with sufficient experience selling into these new markets and our ability to continue to develop products which meet the needs of customers in these markets and which are not currently offered by our competitors. In addition, due to the highly specialized nature of certain of our product offerings in these non-semiconductor markets, we do not expect broad market penetration in many of these markets. If we are unable to expand our sales in non-semiconductor markets, our net revenues and results of operations will remain substantially dependent upon the cycles of the semiconductor and ATE markets.. Changes in the buying patterns of our customers have affected, and may continue to affect, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins. Such changes in patterns are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent.    In addition to the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins have also been affected by changes in the buying patterns of our customers. We believe that in recent years there have been a variety of changes within the ATE market, including, for example, changing product requirements, longer time periods between new product offerings by OEMs and changes in customer buying patterns. In particular, demand for the products sold by EMS, which are sold exclusively within the ATE market, and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape, including (i) customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times (which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs) and ordering in smaller quantities (which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs), (ii) the increasing practice of OEMs specifying other suppliers as primary vendors, with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations, (iii) customers requiring products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost, and (iv) customer supply chain management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors. These shifts in market practices have had, and may continue to have, varying degrees of impact on our net revenues and our gross and net operating margins. Such shifts are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent, and the impact of these practices is difficult to quantify from period to period. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter these shifts.    We generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of our large customers, operating results could suffer dramatically.    During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Hakuto Co. Ltd., one of our distributors, accounted for 11% and 13% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. These revenues were generated by our Thermal segment. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 11% and 10% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. While both of our operating segments sold products to this customer, these revenues were primarily generated by our EMS segment. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 46% and 50% of our consolidated net revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer, could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. - 14 -. Table of Contents. Our operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price.    Historically, our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In addition to the changing cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past, and that may cause fluctuations and losses in the future, include:. <U+25CF>  \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcontingent consideration liability adjustments;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in demand in the markets we serve outside the ATE market including the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunication markets;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe state of the U.S. and global economies;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the buying patterns of our customers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in our market share;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe technological obsolescence of our inventories;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tquantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in the level of product warranty charges;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetitive pricing pressures;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts related to due diligence and transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that does not get completed;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant consolidations and relocations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texcess manufacturing capacity;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to control operating costs;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in shipments of our products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe mix of our products sold;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the level of our fixed costs;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcosts associated with the development of our proprietary technology;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in costs of component materials;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in government regulations; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical or economic instability.. Because the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on, and in relation to, changes in our operating results, fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue.    In connection with our acquisition of Ambrell in May 2017, we agreed to contingent consideration in the form of earnouts based on the future adjusted EBITDA of Ambrell for 2017 and 2018. Significant variation in the amount of the estimated fair value of contingent consideration from period to period is possible which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.. The consideration paid for the acquisition of Ambrell, which we acquired in May 2017, includes contingent consideration in the form of earnouts based on the future adjusted EBITDA of Ambrell. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings (or loss) from operations before interest expense, benefit or provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excludes other non-recurring income and expense items as defined in the stock purchase agreement for Ambrell. The first earnout, to be paid after calendar year 2017 is completed, is an amount equal to 8x Ambrell's adjusted EBITDA for 2017 minus the $22 million paid at closing. At December 31, 2017, we had accrued $5.4 million as the 2017 earnout payable on our balance sheet representing the amount of the first earnout. The second earnout, if any, to be paid after calendar year 2018 is completed, will be an amount equal to 8x Ambrell's adjusted EBITDA for 2018 minus the sum of the $22 million paid at closing and the earnout paid with respect to 2017. The 2017 and 2018 earnouts, in the aggregate, are capped at $18 million. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date, an option based income approach using a Monte Carlo simulation model was utilized due to the non-linear payout structure. This resulted in an estimated fair value of $4.1 million, which was recorded as a contingent consideration liability as of the acquisition date. At December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability had increased to $11.1 million, and, accordingly, during the second half of 2017, we recorded a $7.0 million increase in the amounts accrued for contingent consideration. We use this same option based income approach to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the end of each quarter. Significant variation in the amount of the estimated fair value of contingent consideration from period to period is possible as the fair value is affected by our then current estimation of future events including future net revenues and other items that affect future projected adjusted EBITDA. Such variation could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.. - 15 -. Table of Contents. A breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.    We rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and significantly increase our costs. In addition, domestic and international regulatory agencies have implemented, and are continuing to implement, various reporting and remediation requirements that companies must comply with upon learning of a breach. While we have insurance that may protect us from incurring some of these costs, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage is adequate to cover all costs and damages incurred in connection with a cyberattack.    Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to innovation in the semiconductor and ATE markets.    Semiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ICs into an increasing variety of products. This trend, and the changes needed in automated testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor market, are likely to continue. We cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in developing, manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or that will attain market acceptance. Our failure to provide products that effectively and timely meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects.    If our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.    Certain components may be in short supply from time to time because of high demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. A significant portion of our material purchases require some custom work and there are not always multiple suppliers capable of performing such custom work on a timely or cost effective basis. If any of our suppliers were to cancel commitments or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have reduced revenues and earnings, and be subject to contractual penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Our business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.    The loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and other key employees or the development of successors with commensurate skills and talents. In the past, during periods of weakened demand which has caused us to experience operating losses, we have implemented temporary salary and benefit reductions and eliminations that have remained in place until our operations returned to profitability. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate and we were to implement such salary and benefit reductions or eliminations again, or if we cannot continue to increase employee salaries and maintain employee benefits commensurate with competitive opportunities, we may not be able to retain our senior management and other key employees. Our business could suffer if we were to lose one of more of our senior officers or other key employees.    A substantial portion of our customers are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.    We have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non-U.S. customers. Our foreign subsidiaries generated 17% and 16% of consolidated net revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net revenues from foreign customers totaled $46.6 million, or 70% of consolidated net revenues in 2016, and $27.2 million, or 68% of consolidated net revenues in 2016. We expect our net revenues from foreign customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues. However, in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the U.S., sales to customers outside the U.S. and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks, which may, in the future, affect our operations. These risks include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpolitical and economic instability in foreign countries;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe need to comply with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign import and export laws;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttrade restrictions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tariffs and taxes;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlonger payment cycles;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe greater difficulty of administering business abroad.. - 16 -. Table of Contents. A significant portion of our cash position is maintained overseas and we may not be able to repatriate cash from overseas which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.     While much of our cash is in the U.S., a significant portion is generated from and maintained by our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2017, $2.5 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address our cash requirements or we are unable to efficiently and timely repatriate cash from overseas. Any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. If we are unable to repatriate the earnings of our subsidiaries it could have an adverse impact on our ability to redeploy earnings in other jurisdictions where they could be used more profitably.    We have experienced and may continue to experience significant variability in our effective tax rates and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and costs.    We are subject to paying income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries in which we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could negatively affect our financial results.    Claims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses.    From time to time, we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer's rights. These claims, regardless of merit, may consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays. Any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results. We may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may be costly to us. If we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms, our business could suffer. In instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others, or that someone may be infringing our patent rights, we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question, as well as the potentially infringing conduct. If we become involved in a dispute, neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel's conclusions.. - 17 -.
