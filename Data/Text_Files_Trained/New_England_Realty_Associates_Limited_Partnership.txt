[1] "ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS. We are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as described below. These risks and uncertainties may not be the only ones we face; there may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently consider immaterial. All of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our ability to pay distributions on, and the market price of, our equity securities may be adversely affected if any of such risks are realized. All investors should consider the following risk factors before deciding to purchase or sell securities of the Partnership.. We are subject to risks inherent in the ownership of real estate.  We own and manage multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties that are subject to varying degrees of risk generally incident to the ownership of real estate. Our financial condition, the value of our properties and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be dependent upon our ability to operate our properties in a manner sufficient to generate income in excess of operating expenses and debt service charges, which may be affected by the following risks, some of which are discussed in more detail below:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the economic climate in the markets in which we own and manage properties, including interest rates, the overall level of economic activity, the availability of consumer credit and mortgage financing, unemployment rates and other factors;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta lessening of demand for the multifamily and commercial units that we own;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition from other available multifamily residential and commercial units and changes in market rental rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdevelopment by competitors of competing multi - family communities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in property and liability insurance costs;. 7. Table of Contents.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in real estate taxes and other operating expenses (e.g., cleaning, utilities, repair and maintenance costs, insurance and administrative costs, security, landscaping, pest control, staffing, snow removal and other general costs);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in laws and regulations affecting properties (including tax, environmental, zoning and building codes, and housing laws and regulations);.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tweather and other conditions that might adversely affect operating expenses;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpenditures that cannot be anticipated, such as utility rate and usage increases, unanticipated repairs and real estate tax valuation reassessments or mileage rate increases;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour inability to control operating expenses or achieve increases in revenues;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe results of litigation filed or to be filed against us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks related to our joint ventures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks of personal injury claims and property damage related to mold claims because of diminished insurance coverage;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcatastrophic property damage losses that are not covered by our insurance;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trisks associated with property acquisitions such as environmental liabilities, among others;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in market conditions that may limit or prevent us from acquiring or selling properties;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe perception of tenants and prospective tenants as to the attractiveness, convenience and safety of our properties or the neighborhoods in which they are located; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Partnership does not carry directors and officers insurance.. We are dependent on rental income from our multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties.  If we are unable to attract and retain tenants or if our tenants are unable to pay their rental obligations, our financial condition and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will be adversely affected.. Our multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties are subject to competition.  Our properties and joint venture investments are located in developed areas that include other properties. The properties also compete with other rental alternatives, such as condominiums, single and multifamily rental homes, owner occupied single and multifamily homes, and commercial properties in attracting tenants. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain residents and to increase or maintain rental rates.. The properties we own are concentrated in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire.  Our performance, therefore, is linked to economic conditions and the market for available rental housing and commercial space in these states. A decline in the market for apartment housing and/or commercial properties may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover certain risks.  There are certain types of risks, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, floods, windstorms, act of war and terrorist attacks that may be uninsurable, or are not economically insurable, or are not fully covered by insurance. Moreover, certain risks, such as mold and environmental exposures, generally are not covered by our insurance. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, we could lose our equity in the affected property as well as the anticipated future cash flow from. 8. Table of Contents. that property. Any such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Debt financing could adversely affect our performance.  The vast majority of our assets are encumbered by project specific, non - recourse, non -  cross - collateralized mortgage debt. There is a risk that these properties will not have sufficient cash flow from operations for payments of required principal and interest. We may not be able to refinance these loans at an amount equal to the loan balance and the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If we are unable to make required payments on indebtedness that is secured by a mortgage, the Partnership will either invest additional money in the property or the property securing the mortgage may be foreclosed with a consequent loss of income and value to us.. We are obligated to comply with financial covenants in our indebtedness that could restrict our range of operating activities. The mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants, including limitations on our ability, without prior consent of the lender and other items. Failure to comply with these covenants could cause a default under the agreements and, in certain circumstances; our lenders may be entitled to accelerate our debt obligations. Defaults under our debt agreements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.. Real estate investments are generally illiquid, and we may not be able to sell our properties when it is economically or strategically advantageous to do so.  Real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly, and our ability to sell properties may be affected by market conditions. We may not be able to diversify or vary our portfolio promptly in accordance with our strategies or in response to economic or other conditions.. Our access to public debt markets is limited.  Substantially all of our debt financings are secured by mortgages on our properties because of our limited access to public debt markets.. Litigation may result in unfavorable outcomes.  Like many real estate operators, we may be involved in lawsuits involving premises liability claims, housing discrimination claims and alleged violations of landlord - tenant laws, which may give rise to class action litigation or governmental investigations. Any material litigation not covered by insurance, such as a class action, could result in substantial costs being incurred. The Partnership does not carry directors and officer's liability insurance.. Our financial results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to sell properties and employ the proceeds in accordance with our strategic plan.  Our ability to pay down debt, reduce our interest costs, repurchase Depositary Receipts and acquire properties is dependent upon our ability to sell the properties we have selected for disposition at the prices and within the deadlines we have established for each respective property.. The costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.  Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \"ADA\") to the extent that they are \"public accommodations\" or \"commercial facilities\" as defined in the ADA. The ADA does not consider apartment complexes to be public accommodations or commercial facilities, except for portions of such properties that are open to the public. In addition, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (the \"FHAA\") requires apartment complexes first occupied after March 13, 1990, to be accessible to the handicapped. Other laws also require apartment communities to be handicap accessible. Noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We may be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of handicap design laws in connection with certain of our developments. If compliance with these laws involves substantial expenditures or must be made on an accelerated basis, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.. Under various federal, state and local laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in the property. This liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the substances. Other law imposes on owners and operators certain requirements regarding conditions and activities that may affect human health or the environment. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could complicate our ability to lease or sell an affected property and could subject us to monetary penalties, costs required to achieve compliance and potential. 9. Table of Contents. liability to third parties. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. Nonetheless, it is possible that material environmental contamination or conditions exist, or could arise in the future, in the apartment communities or on the land upon which they are located.. We are subject to the risks associated with investments through joint ventures.  Nine of our properties are owned by joint ventures in which we do not have a direct controlling interest. We may enter into joint ventures, including joint ventures that we do not control, in the future. Any joint venture investment involves risks such as the possibility that the co -  venturer may seek relief under federal or state insolvency laws, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals. While the bankruptcy or insolvency of our co - venturer generally should not disrupt the operations of the joint venture, we could be forced to purchase the co - venturer's interest in the joint venture or the interest could be sold to a third party. We also may guarantee the indebtedness of our joint ventures. If we do not have control over a joint venture, the value of our investment may be affected adversely by a third party that may have different goals and capabilities than ours.. We are subject to risks associated with development, acquisition and expansion of multifamily apartment complexes and commercial properties.  Development projects and acquisitions and expansions of apartment complexes are subject to a number of risks, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tavailability of acceptable financing;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcompetition with other entities for investment opportunities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure by our properties to achieve anticipated operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction costs of a property exceeding original estimates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdelays in construction; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpenditure of funds on, and the devotion of management time to, transactions that may not come to fruition.. We are subject to control by our directors and officers.  The directors and executive officers of the General Partner and members of their families and related entities owned approximately 35% of our depositary receipts as of December 31, 2017. Additionally, management decisions rest with our General Partner without limited partner approval.. Competition for skilled personnel could increase our labor costs.  We and our management company compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel who are responsible for the day -  to - day operations of our properties. Competitive pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge our tenants. If there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our business and operating results could be harmed.. We depend on our key personnel.  Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contribution of key members of the management company, who may be difficult to replace. The loss of services of these executives could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that the services of such personnel will continue to be available to us. We do not hold key - man life insurance on any of our key personnel.. 10. Table of Contents. Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our Depositary Receipts.  As with other publicly traded equity securities, the value of our depositary receipts depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the value of our depositary receipts are the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe extent of investor interest in us;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe general reputation of real estate companies and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour financial performance; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgeneral stock and bond market conditions.. The market value of our depositary is based primarily upon the market's perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions. Consequently, our depositary receipts may trade at prices that are higher or lower than our net asset value per depositary receipt.. We face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.  We cannot predict with the certainty whether climate change is occurring and, if so at what rate. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material effect on our properties, operations, and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our markets could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for our buildings or the inability of us to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, increasing the cost of energy and increasing the cost of snow removal at our properties. Proposed federal legislation to address climate change could increase utility and other costs of operating our properties which, if not offset by rising rental income, would reduce our net income. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer  In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our tenants and business partners, including personally identifiable information of our tenants and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.. Risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate partnerships.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and therefore, may adversely affect taxation to us, and/or our partners."
