[1] "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. We are subject to various risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the price of our shares, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.. Risks Related to Our Business. Decreased customer expenditure levels have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.. Demand for our services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and gas and mining companies.  Although we have seen an increase in oil prices in late 2016 and through 2017, we are not expecting significant improvement in customer activity in the near-term, as we anticipate that our customers’ expenditures will generally lag increased oil prices by nine to 12 months. If our customers’ expenditures fail to increase in regions where our facilities are located, our business will be adversely impacted. The oil and gas and mining industries’ willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive resource prospects and the prevailing view of future commodity prices, which over the past year, has not been positive. Prices for oil, coal, natural gas, and other minerals are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, a sudden or long-term decline in commodity pricing, or a continuation of the current depressed commodity price environment, would have material adverse effects on our results of operations.. During the first quarter of 2016, global oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over ten years due to concerns over global oil demand, global crude inventory levels, worldwide economic growth and price cutting by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. Increasing global supply, including increased U.S. shale oil production, also negatively impacted pricing. With falling West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices, Western Canadian Select (WCS) also fell. Oil prices and WCS have rebounded in recent periods. WCS prices in the fourth quarter of 2017 averaged $38.65 per barrel compared to a low of $20.26 in the first quarter of 2016 and a high of $83.78 in the second quarter of 2014.  As of February 16, 2018, the WTI price was $61.68, and the WCS price was $35.05.. In addition, met coal prices have fluctuated from approximately $119/metric tonne as of December 31, 2014 to approximately $92.50/metric tonne as of September 30, 2016, due to a declining demand for steel and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.  Steel demand rebounding in 2017 and the weakening of the U.S. dollar has led to higher met coal pricing.  As of February 19, 2018, spot prices for met coal were $229.25/metric tonne and benchmark contract prices for the first quarter of 2018 paid to Australian metallurgical coal producers by Japanese steel producers had not settled.  The increase in met coal pricing in 2017 and early 2018 have not led our customers to approve any significant new projects. The low commodity price environment has significantly depressed exploration, development, and production activity.  A deterioration of this price environment is likely to continue to depress activity levels, often reflected as reductions in employees or resource production, and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Additionally, significant new regulatory requirements, including climate change legislation, could have an impact on the demand for and the cost of producing oil, coal and natural gas in the regions where we operate. Many factors affect the supply of and demand for oil, coal, natural gas and other minerals and, therefore, influence product prices, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe level of activity and developments in the Canadian oil sands; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe global level of demand, particularly from China, for coal and other natural resources produced in Australia;. 25. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe availability of economically attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict development; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe availability of transportation infrastructure for oil, natural gas, LNG and coal, refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tglobal weather conditions and natural disasters; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide economic activity including growth in developing countries, such as China and India; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tnational government political requirements, including the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe level of oil and gas production by non-OPEC countries; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\trapid technological change and the timing and extent of energy resource development, including LNG or other alternative fuels; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental regulation; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tU.S. and foreign tax policies.. Our failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new customer contracts, or the termination of existing contracts, could adversely affect our business.. Our success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew or replace our existing customer contracts and obtain new business. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including overall customer expenditure levels and the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing, or at all, or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us. Because of the current depressed commodity price environment, our customers may not renew contracts on terms favorable to us or, in some cases, at all, and we may have difficulty obtaining new business. Additionally, several contracts have clauses that allow termination upon the payment of a termination fee. As a result, our customers may choose to terminate their contracts. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market weakness like those we are currently experiencing. Further, certain of our customers may not reach positive final investment decisions on projects with respect to which we have been awarded contracts to provide related accommodation, which may cause those customers to terminate the contracts. Customer contract cancellations, the failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts or the failure to obtain new business would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.. Due to the cyclical nature of the natural resources industry, our business may be adversely affected by extended periods of low oil, coal or natural gas prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease our customers’ spending and therefore our results.. Commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. This volatility causes oil and gas and mining companies to change their strategies and expenditure levels. Prices of oil, coal and natural gas can be influenced by many factors, including reduced demand due to lower global economic growth, surplus inventory, improved technology such as the hydraulic fracturing of horizontally drilled wells in shale discoveries, access to potential productive regions and availability of required infrastructure to deliver production to the marketplace. In particular, global demand for both oil and metallurgical coal is, at least partially, dependent on the growth of the Chinese economy. Should gross domestic product growth in China slow further or contract, demand for oil and metallurgical coal and, correspondingly, our accommodations would fall, which would negatively impact our financial results.. 26. Our business typically supports projects that are capital intensive and require several years to generate first production. The economic analyses conducted by our customers in oil sands, Australian mining and LNG investment areas have historically assumed a relatively conservative longer-term price outlook for production from such projects to determine economic viability. Because of the recent depressed commodity price environment, our customers have reduced or deferred, and may continue to reduce or defer, major expenditures, particularly in Canada and Australia, given the long-term nature of many large scale development projects, adversely affecting our revenues and profitability.. In Canada, WCS crude is the benchmark price for our oil sands accommodations customers. Pricing for WCS is driven by several factors, including the underlying price for WTI and the availability of transportation infrastructure. Historically, WCS has traded at a discount to WTI. Should the price of WTI decline or the WCS discount to WTI widen further, our oil sands customers may delay or eliminate additional investments, further reduce their spending in the oil sands region or curtail or shut-down additional existing operations. Similarly, the volumes and prices of the mineral products of our customers, including coal and gold, have historically varied significantly and are difficult to predict. The demand for, and price of, these minerals and commodities is highly dependent on a variety of factors, including international supply and demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, actions taken by governments and global economic and political developments. Mineral and commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. No assurance can be given regarding future volumes or prices relating to the activities of our customers. We have experienced in the past, and expect to experience in the future, significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes.. In addition, the carrying value of our lodges or villages could be reduced by extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers, which has required us to record impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of the lodges or villages over fair value. We recorded impairments of our long-lived assets of $31.6 million and $46.1 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also recorded goodwill impairments of $43.2 million in 2015. We may incur additional asset impairment charges in the future, which charges will affect negatively our results of operations and financial condition.. Exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. dollar reported results of operations and financial position.. Currency exchange rate fluctuations can create volatility in our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate net revenues or earnings in countries whose currency is not the U.S. dollar, the translation of such amounts into U.S. dollars can result in an increase or decrease in our reported revenues, net income, financial condition and cash flows depending upon exchange rate movements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 93% of our revenues originated from subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and were denominated in either the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our reported revenues, net income, financial condition and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and we are exposed to currency exchange risk primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian and Australian dollars. We may attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation where possible by entering into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency exposure. Our efforts to limit exchange risks may be unsuccessful, thereby exposing us to foreign currency fluctuations that could cause our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows to deteriorate.. We do business in Canada and Australia, whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the United States.. A significant portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in Canada and Australia. These activities accounted for 93% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017. Risks associated with our operations in Canada and Australia include, but are not limited to:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tinternational currency fluctuations;. 27. <U+25CF> \t\t\tdifferent taxing regimes; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tchanging political conditions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tchanging international and U.S. monetary policies; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tregional economic downturns; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\texpropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tforeign exchange limitations.. The regulatory regimes in these countries are substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of non-U.S. laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.. All but one of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases. If we are unable to renew a lease, we could be materially and adversely affected.. All but one of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases. Accordingly, while we own the accommodations assets, we only own a leasehold in those properties. If we are found to be in breach of a lease, we could lose the right to use the property. In addition, unless we can extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate our facilities located on these properties upon expiration of the leases. In that event, we would be required to remove our accommodations assets and remediate the site. Generally, our leases have an initial term of ten years and will expire between 2023 and 2027 unless extended. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to renew our leases upon expiration on similar terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew leases on similar terms, it may have an adverse effect on our business.. Due to the significant concentration of our business in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada and in the Bowen Basin coal region of Queensland, Australia, adverse events in these areas could negatively impact our business, and our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services.. Because of the concentration of our business in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada and in the coal producing region of Queensland, Australia, two relatively small geographic areas, we have increased exposure to political, regulatory, environmental, labor, climate or natural disaster events or developments that could disproportionately impact our operations and financial results. For example, in 2017, a cyclone impacted areas near our villages in Australia. Also in 2011 and 2016, forest fires in northern Alberta impacted areas near our Canadian oil sands lodges. Due to our geographic concentration, any adverse events or developments in our operating areas may disproportionately affect our financial results.. In addition, a limited number of companies operate in the areas in which our business is concentrated, and occupancy at each of our lodges may be constrained by the radius which potential customers are willing to transport their workers. Our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services, and as to any single lodge or village, we may have few potential customers. Therefore, we are subject to volatility in occupancy in any location based on the capital spending plans of a limited number of customers, based on their changing decisions as to whether to outsource or use their own company-owned accommodations and whether other potential customers move into that lodge’s radius.. Development of permanent infrastructure in the Canadian oil sands region, the west coast of British Columbia, regions of Australia or various U.S. locations where we locate our assets could negatively impact our business.. We specialize in providing housing and personnel logistics for work forces in remote areas which often lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities. If permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop, grow or otherwise become available in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada, the west coast of British Columbia or regions of Australia where we locate villages, then demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services.. 28. We depend on several significant customers. The loss of one or more such customers or the inability of one or more such customers to meet their obligations to us could adversely affect our results of operations.. We depend on several significant customers. The majority of our customers operate in the energy or mining industry. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see “Business” in Item 1 of this annual report. The loss of any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in two industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. While we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, we do not require collateral in support of our trade receivables.. As a result of our customer concentration, risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business. We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. Although we have seen an increase in oil prices in late 2016 and through 2017, commodity prices have remained depressed since 2015, and the capital markets and availability of credit have been constrained relative to historical levels. Additionally, many of our customers’ equity values have declined and could decline further. The combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may continue to result in a significant reduction in our customers’ liquidity and could impair their ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results.. We are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.. Our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in Canada and Australia, and, to a lesser extent, the Rocky Mountain region and the Permian Basin. A portion of our Canadian operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and, as a result, adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services in the second and, to a lesser extent, third quarters. During the Australian rainy season, generally between the months of November and April, our operations in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia can be affected by cyclones, monsoons and resultant flooding. Severe winter weather conditions in the Rocky Mountain region and the Permian Basin of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our customers. Furthermore, the areas in which we operate are susceptible to forest fires, which could interrupt our operations and adversely impact our earnings.. Our customers are exposed to a number of unique operating risks and challenges which could also adversely affect us.. We could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to our clients’ operations caused by any one of or all of the following singularly or in combination:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tU.S. and international pricing and demand for the natural resource being produced at a given project (or proposed project); \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tunexpected problems, higher costs and delays during the development, construction and project start-up which may delay the commencement of production;. 29. <U+25CF> \t\t\tunforeseen and adverse geological, geotechnical, seismic and mining conditions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tlack of availability of sufficient water or power to maintain their operations; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tlack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure necessary to maintain or to expand their operations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their operations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\trisks associated with the natural resources industry being subject to various regulatory approvals. Such risks may include a government agency failing to grant an approval or failing to renew an existing approval, or the approval or renewal not being provided by the government agency in a timely manner or the government agency granting or renewing an approval subject to materially onerous conditions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\trisks to land titles, mining titles and use thereof as a result of native title claims; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tclaims by persons living in close proximity to mining projects, which may have an impact on the consents granted; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tinterruptions to the operations of our customers caused by industrial accidents or disputes; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdelays in or failure to commission new infrastructure in timeframes so as not to disrupt customer operations.. We may be adversely affected if customers reduce their accommodations outsourcing.. Our business and growth strategies depend in large part on customers outsourcing some or all of the services that we provide. Many oil and gas and mining companies in our core markets own their own accommodations facilities, while others outsource all or part of their accommodations requirements. Customers have largely built their accommodations in the past but will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost or allow them to accelerate the timing of their projects. We cannot be certain that these customer preferences will continue or that customers that have outsourced accommodations will not decide to perform these functions themselves or only outsource accommodations during the development or construction phases of their projects. In addition, labor unions representing customer employees and contractors have, in the past, opposed outsourcing accommodations to the extent that the unions believe that third-party accommodations negatively impact union membership and recruiting. The reversal or reduction in customer outsourcing of accommodations could negatively impact our financial results and growth prospects.. Increased operating costs and obstacles to cost recovery due to the pricing and cancellation terms of our accommodation services contracts may constrain our ability to make a profit.. Our profitability can be adversely affected to the extent we are faced with cost increases for food, wages and other labor related expenses, insurance, fuel and utilities, especially to the extent we are unable to recover such increased costs through increases in the prices for our services, due to one or more of general economic conditions, competitive conditions or contractual provisions in our customer contracts. Substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in cost increases in our lodges and villages. From time to time we have experienced increases in our food costs. While we believe a portion of these increases were attributable to fuel prices, we believe the increases also resulted from rising global food demand. In addition, food prices can fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange rates and temporary changes in supply, including as a result of incidences of severe weather such as droughts, heavy rains and late freezes. While our long term contracts often provide for annual escalation in our room rates for food, labor and utility inflation, we may be unable to fully recover costs and such increases would negatively impact our profitability on contracts that do not contain such inflation protections.. 30. A failure to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages or serving alcoholic beverages may subject us to liability.. Claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and a number of these claims may exist at any given time. Because food safety issues could be experienced at the source or by food suppliers or distributors, food safety could, in part, be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our locations could adversely impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business, and have a negative impact on our sales. Future food product recalls and health concerns associated with food contamination may also increase our raw materials costs and, from time to time, disrupt our business.. A variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food (including, in some cases, requirements relating to the temperature of food), and the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level. We cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. Furthermore, legislation and regulatory attention to food safety is very high. Additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance or expose us to liabilities.. We serve alcoholic beverages at some of our facilities, and must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as local service laws. These laws generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as a patron who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate these laws, we may be liable to the patron and/or third parties for the acts of the patron. We cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us. There can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the jurisdictions in which we serve alcoholic beverages. If we are unable to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food, beverages or alcoholic beverages, the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.. Our land banking strategy may not be successful.. Our land banking strategy is focused on investing early in land in order to gain a strategic, early mover advantage in an emerging region or resource play. However, we cannot assure you that all land that we purchase or lease will be in a region in which our customers require our services in the future. We also cannot assure you that the property acquired by us will be profitably developed. Our land banking strategy involves significant risks that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and the market price of our securities, which include the following risks:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe regions in which we invest may not develop or sustain adequate customer demand; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may incur costs to acquire land and/or construct assets without securing a customer contract or prior to finalization of an accommodations contract with a customer and, if the contract is not obtained or delayed, the resulting impact could result in an impairment of the related investment; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tduring the time between acquisition and use, and depending on adjacent uses of the land, the property may become unusable or require costly remediation efforts due to environmental damage; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\twe may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms or at all; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations, and the issuance of permits is dependent upon a number of factors, including water and waste treatment alternatives available, road traffic volumes and fire conditions in forested areas; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdevelopment opportunities that we explore may be abandoned and the related investment impaired; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe properties may perform below anticipated levels, producing cash flow below budgeted amounts;. 31. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tconstruction costs, total investment amounts and our share of remaining funding may exceed our estimates and projects may not be completed, delivered or stabilized as planned; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may experience delays (temporary or permanent) if there is public, government or aboriginal opposition to our activities; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tsubstantial renovation, new development and redevelopment activities, regardless of their ultimate success, typically require a significant amount of management’s time and attention, diverting their attention from our day-to-day operations.. Our business is contract intensive and may lead to customer disputes or delays in receipt of payments.. Our business is contract intensive and we are party to many contracts with customers. We periodically review our compliance with contract terms and provisions. If customers were to dispute our contract determinations, the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect sales and operating results. In the past, our customers have withheld payment due to contract or other disputes, which has delayed our receipt of payments. While we do not believe any reviews, audits, delayed payments or other such matters should result in material adjustments, if a large number of our customer arrangements were modified or payments withheld in response to any such matter, the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations.. We are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.. All of our operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third-parties. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent requirements. The implementation of new laws and regulations could result in materially increased costs, stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, particularly for our customers, and could have an adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. See “Business - Government Regulation” in Item 1 of this annual report for a more detailed description of our risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.. Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including the:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tissuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdenial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\treduction or cessation of operations; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tperformance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.. Construction risks exist which may adversely affect our results of operations.. There are a number of general risks that might impinge on companies involved in the development, construction, manufacture and installation of facilities as a prerequisite to the management of those assets in an operational sense. We might be exposed to these risks from time to time by relying on these corporations and/or other third parties which could include any and/or all of the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe construction activities of our accommodations are partially dependent on the supply of appropriate construction and development opportunities;. 32. <U+25CF> \t\t\tdevelopment approvals, slow decision making by counterparties, complex construction specifications, changes to design briefs, legal issues and other documentation changes may give rise to delays in completion, loss of revenue and cost over-runs which may, in turn, result in termination of accommodation supply contracts; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tother time delays that may arise in relation to construction and development include supply of labor, scarcity of construction materials, lower than expected productivity levels, inclement weather conditions, land contamination, cultural heritage claims, difficult site access or industrial relations issues; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tobjections to our activities or those of our customers aired by aboriginal or community interests, environment and/or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting or approvals and/or the overall progress of a project; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twhere we assume design responsibility, there is a risk that design problems or defects may result in rectification and/or costs or liabilities which we cannot readily recover; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthere is a risk that we may fail to fulfill our statutory and contractual obligations in relation to the quality of our materials and workmanship, including warranties and defect liability obligations.. The cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn has and could in the future negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets.. We recorded impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangibles, of $31.6 million, $46.1 million and $79.7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also recorded goodwill impairments of $43.2 million in 2015.. Extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers at our lodges or villages could require us to record further impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value of the lodges or villages over fair value. We may recognize additional impairment losses on our long-lived assets in the future if, among other factors:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tglobal economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, including a further decrease in the price of or demand for oil, natural gas and minerals; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe outlook for future profits and cash flow for our Canadian and Australian reporting units deteriorates as the result of many possible factors, including, but not limited to, increased or unanticipated competition, technology becoming obsolete, need to satisfy changes in customers’ accommodations requirements, further reductions in customer capital spending plans, loss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory judgment(s), future operating losses at a reporting unit, downward forecast revisions or restructuring plans or if certain of our customers do not reach positive final investment decisions on projects with respect to which we have been awarded contracts to provide related accommodation, which may cause those customers to terminate the contracts; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tcosts of equity or debt capital increase; or \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tvaluations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate.. An accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.. There is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, because of air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Certain environmental statutes impose joint and several strict liability for these costs. For example, an accidental release by us in the performance of services at one of our or our customers’ sites could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.. 33. We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.. Climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of any change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of depleting natural resources.. There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of Canadian, Australian, U.S. federal, regional, provincial and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. These actions could:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tresult in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers’ operations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tincrease other costs to our business; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\treduce the demand for carbon-based fuels; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\treduce the demand for our services.. Any adoption of these or similar proposals by Canadian, Australian, U.S. federal, regional, provincial or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. See “Business—Government Regulation” in Item 1 of this annual report for a more detailed description of our climate-change related risks.. Our inability to control the inherent risks of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.. Acquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. We may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to shareholders.. We expect to gain certain business, financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. An inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tretaining key employees of acquired businesses; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tretaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tretaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain;. 34. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tincreased administrative burden; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tdeveloping our sales and marketing capabilities; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tmanaging our growth effectively; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tpotential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tintegrating operations; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tmanaging tax and foreign exchange exposure; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tpotentially operating a new line of business; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tincreased logistical problems common to large, expansive operations; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tinability to pursue and protect patents covering acquired technology.. Additionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and our shareholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.. We may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and insurance may not cover certain liabilities, including litigation.. Our operations are subject to many hazards. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses. We maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, we are insured under Oil States’ insurance policies for occurrences prior to the completion of the Spin-off. The specifications and insured limits under those policies, however, may be insufficient for such claims. We also face the following other risks related to our insurance coverage:. <U+25CF> \t\t\twe may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tthe counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\twe may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage.. Our operations may suffer due to increased industry-wide capacity of certain types of assets.. The demand for and/or pricing of rooms and accommodation service is subject to the overall availability of rooms in the marketplace. If demand for our assets were to decrease, or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our capacity in excess of current demand, we may encounter decreased pricing for or utilization of our assets and services, which could adversely impact our operations and profits.. 35. In addition, we significantly increased our capacity in the Canadian oil sands region and in Australia over the past several years based on our previous expectations for customer demand for accommodations in these areas. However, due to the sustained decline in commodity prices throughout 2015 and 2016 and into 2017, customer demand for accommodations in those areas has decreased significantly, and we have experienced a corresponding significant decrease in our occupancy and profitability. Should our customers build their own facilities to meet their accommodations needs or our competitors likewise increase their available accommodations, or activity in the oil sands or natural resources regions declines further, demand and/or pricing for our accommodations could further decrease, negatively impacting our profitability.. We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business will suffer.. The workforce accommodation, logistics and facility management industry in which we operate is highly competitive. To be successful, we must provide services that meet the specific needs of our customers at competitive prices. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are service quality and availability, price, technical knowledge and experience and reputation for safety. We compete with international and regional competitors, several of which are significantly larger than us. These competitors offer similar services in the geographic regions in which we operate. Many oil and gas and mining companies in our core markets own their own accommodations facilities, while others outsource all or part of their accommodations requirements. As a result of competition, we may be unable to continue to provide our present services, to provide such services at historical operating margins or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Reduced levels of activity in the workforce accommodation industry can intensify competition and result in lower revenue to us.. Loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business.. We depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of our management. If any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain “key man” life insurance for any of our officers.. Employee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us.. As of December 31, 2017, we were party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 850 employees in Canada and 130 employees in Australia.  Efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce.  In addition, our facilities serving oil sands development work in Northern Alberta, Canada and mining operations in Australia house both union and non-union customer employees.  We have not experienced strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns in the past, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future.  A prolonged strike, work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additional unionization efforts and new collective bargaining agreements also could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our flexibility.  Collective bargaining agreements in our Canadian operations have individual expiration dates, extending in some cases to 2020.  One enterprise bargaining agreement exists in our Australian operation covering certain employees working at our villages in Queensland and New South Wales.  This agreement was renewed in 2017.. Failure to maintain positive relationships with the indigenous people in the areas where we operate could adversely affect our business.. A component of our business strategy is based on developing and maintaining positive relationships with the indigenous people and communities in the areas where we operate. These relationships are important to our operations and customers who desire to work on traditional aboriginal lands. The inability to develop and maintain relationships and to be in compliance with local requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.. The enforcement of civil liabilities against Civeo may be more difficult.. Civeo is a British Columbia company and a substantial portion of its assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. In addition, some claims may be more difficult to bring against Civeo in Canadian courts than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.. 36. We may increase our debt or issue equity in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.. We may increase our debt or issue equity in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred shares, including the issuance of preferred shares in connection with the Noralta Acquisition, the terms of the debt or our preferred shares issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common shares, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your ownership in us would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us.. Our Amended Credit Agreement contains operating and financial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our Amended Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit or restrict (i) subsidiary indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes, (ii) asset sales, (iii) margin stock, (iv) specified acquisitions, (v) certain restrictive agreements, (vi) transactions with affiliates and (vii) investments and other restricted payments, including dividends and other distributions. Specifically, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) to consolidated interest expense, of at least 3.0 to 1.0 and our maximum leverage ratio, defined as the ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, of no greater than 5.85 to 1.0 (as of December 31, 2017).. The permitted level of the maximum leverage ratio changes over time, as illustrated in the table below.. Period Ended \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tMaximum Leverage  \t\t\tRatio \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\tDecember 31, 2017 \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.85 : 1.00 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\tMarch 31, 2018 \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.85 : 1.00 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\tJune 30, 2018 \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.85 : 1.00 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\tSeptember 30, 2018 \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.85 : 1.00 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\tDecember 31, 2018 \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.50 : 1.00 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\tMarch 31, 2019 & thereafter \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t5.25 : 1.00. Each of the factors considered in the calculations of these ratios are defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. EBITDA and consolidated interest, as defined, exclude goodwill and asset impairments, debt discount amortization and other non-cash charges.. We may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement. The restrictions contained in the Amended Credit Agreement could:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.. 37. Additionally, our ability to comply with some of the covenants, ratios or tests contained in the Amended Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Declines in commodity prices, or a prolonged period of commodity prices at depressed levels, could eventually result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, which could require us to refinance or amend such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.. We may not be able to reduce our indebtedness to comply with these covenants. A failure to comply with these covenants, ratios or tests could result in an event of default. A default under the Amended Credit Agreement, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, in the event of an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility and require repayment of all borrowings outstanding. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facility or any of our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. Moreover, any new indebtedness we incur may impose financial restrictions and other covenants on us that may be more restrictive than our existing debt agreements.. Our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.. We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $297.6 million outstanding under the term loan portion of the Amended Credit Agreement, no borrowings outstanding under the revolving portion of the Amended Credit Agreement, $1.8 million of outstanding letters of credit and capacity to borrow an additional $107.4 million under the revolving portion of the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowings outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement mature in May 2019. As of December 31, 2017, our borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of the Amended Credit Agreement was reduced by approximately $165.8 million due to the negative covenants. If market or other economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, our borrowing capacity may be further reduced.. Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on our indebtedness as such payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour debt covenants also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in its industry; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tour indebtedness could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes.. Our ability to service our debt, including repaying outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement at maturity, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.. 38. Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.. We face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data.. Risks Related to the Noralta Acquisition. There can be no assurance when or even if the Noralta Acquisition will be completed. Failure to obtain required approvals necessary to satisfy closing conditions may delay or prevent completion of the Noralta Acquisition.. The completion of the Noralta Acquisition is subject to a number of closing conditions, some of which are out of our control, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe share issuance proposal being approved by our shareholders; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties at and as of the closing of the Noralta Acquisition (subject to certain materiality qualifiers);. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe performance in all material respects of each party’s obligations under the Purchase Agreement required to be performed by it on or prior to the closing date of the Noralta Acquisition;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) on either party; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe receipt of Canadian regulatory approvals and clearances, including under the Competition Act (Canada) and the Investment Canada Act, and other regulatory and third party consents.. We cannot be certain that our shareholders will approve the share issuance proposal. We have received notice from the Competition Bureau that it does not intend to challenge the acquisition under the Competition Act (Canada), and we have been granted approval under the Investment Canada Act for the acquisition. However, we cannot be certain when we and Noralta will be able to satisfy the other closing conditions or whether those closing conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived prior to May 31, 2018, it is possible that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. Although we and Noralta have agreed in the Purchase Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to certain limitations, to complete the Noralta Acquisition as promptly as possible, these and other conditions to the completion of the Noralta Acquisition may fail to be satisfied.. The pendency of the Noralta Acquisition could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares and our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.. The pendency of the Noralta Acquisition could disrupt our business in the following ways, including:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthird parties may seek to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with us, or may delay or defer certain business decisions, as a result of the Noralta Acquisition, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe attention of our management may be directed toward completion of the Noralta Acquisition and related matters and may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of their respective companies, including from other opportunities that otherwise might be beneficial to us;. 39. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\temployee retention and recruitment may be challenging before the completion of the Noralta Acquisition, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe Purchase Agreement restricts us from taking certain specified actions while the Noralta Acquisition is pending without first obtaining written consent of Noralta, which may restrict us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business before completion of the Noralta Acquisition or termination of the Purchase Agreement.. Should they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.. The rights of holders of our common shares will be subordinate to the rights of the holders of our preferred shares.. The holders of the preferred shares issued in the Noralta Acquisition will have rights and preferences superior to those of the holders of our common shares. These rights include, among others:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tthe right to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common shares; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe right to receive a 2% annual dividend, paid quarterly in cash or, at our option, by increasing the shares’ liquidation preference, or any combination thereof; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe right to convert the preferred shares into common shares after two years from the closing of the Noralta Acquisition at an initial conversion price of US$3.30 per common share, which may not be the fair market value of such shares at the time of conversion.. The Noralta Acquisition may be completed even though material adverse changes subsequent to the announcement of the Noralta Acquisition, such as industry-wide changes or other events, may occur.. In general, either party can refuse to complete the Noralta Acquisition if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party. However, some types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Noralta Acquisition, even if such changes would have a material adverse effect on either of the parties. For example, a worsening of Noralta’s or our financial condition or results of operations due to a decrease in commodity prices or general economic conditions would not give the other party the right to refuse to complete the Noralta Acquisition. If adverse changes occur that affect either party but the parties are still required to complete the Noralta Acquisition, our share price, business and financial results after the Noralta Acquisition may suffer.. Failure to complete the Noralta Acquisition could negatively impact our share price and future business and financial results.. If the Noralta Acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, and we may be subject to several risks, including the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\thaving to pay certain costs relating to the Noralta Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and other fees and expenses; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ta potential decline in the price of our common shares to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Noralta Acquisition will be completed;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the Noralta Acquisition; and. 40. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\thaving had the focus of our management on the Noralta Acquisition instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the company.. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Noralta Acquisition.. We expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Noralta Acquisition, combining the operations of the two organizations and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time.. The failure to integrate our business successfully with Noralta in the expected timeframe would adversely affect our future results following the completion of the Noralta Acquisition.. The success of the Noralta Acquisition will depend, in large part, on our ability following the completion of the Noralta Acquisition to realize the anticipated benefits, including operating synergies, from combining our businesses, which have previously been operated independently. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully integrate Noralta into our business. This integration will be complex and time-consuming, and we and Noralta will only be able to conduct limited planning regarding the integration of the two companies prior to completion of the Noralta Acquisition. Significant management attention and resources will be required to integrate the two companies. Delays in this process could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and share price following the Noralta Acquisition.. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tcomplexities associated with managing the larger, combined business; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegrating personnel from the two companies;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Noralta Acquisition; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the Noralta Acquisition and integrating the companies’ operations.. Even if we were able to integrate the business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies and operational efficiencies that may be possible from this integration and that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time.. The trading price of our common shares after the Noralta Acquisition may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of our common shares before the Noralta Acquisition.. Our results of operations, as well as the trading price of our common shares, after the Noralta Acquisition may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our results of operations and the trading price of our common shares. These factors include:. <U+25CF> \t\t\ta greater number of common shares outstanding as compared to the number of currently outstanding common shares; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferent shareholders; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifferent assets and capital structure.. 41. Accordingly, the historical trading prices and our financial results may not be indicative of future trading prices of the common shares after the Noralta Acquisition.. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Noralta Acquisition.. Following the Noralta Acquisition, the size of our business will be larger than its current business. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We can offer no assurance that we will be successful or will realize the benefits currently anticipated to result from the Noralta Acquisition.. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.. The success of the Noralta Acquisition will depend in part on our ability to retain key Civeo and Noralta employees who continue employment with us after the Noralta Acquisition is completed. It is possible that these employees might decide not to remain with us after the Noralta Acquisition.. If these key employees terminate their employment, our activities might be adversely affected, management’s attention might be diverted from successfully integrating Noralta’s operations to recruiting suitable replacements and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we might not be able to locate suitable replacements for any such key employees who leave the company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.. Our success will also depend on pre-existing relationships with third parties, which relationships may be affected by the Noralta Acquisition. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.. Our success will be dependent on the ability to maintain and renew relationships with pre-existing third parties, including local Aboriginal groups. For example, Noralta currently has two significant contracts for the provision of accommodation services. One of such contracts extends through April 2022, and the second contract has a primary term through 2027, with early termination by the customer permitted starting in 2021. Following the Noralta Acquisition, we will be subject to the risks, among others, of early termination of the contracts, failure to extend the contracts beyond their primary term and a decrease in demand under the contracts below our expectations. In addition, the revenue we will derive under the contracts following the Noralta Acquisition will be variable and depend on the utilization by the customers of our services under the contracts and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will be able to maintain these contracts or other pre-existing business and other relationships, including with local Aboriginal groups, or enter into or maintain other new business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain these contracts and other important pre-existing third party relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations after the Noralta Acquisition.. Risks Related to the Redomicile Transaction. We are subject to various Canadian and other taxes as a result of the Redomicile Transaction.. While we expect the Redomicile Transaction will enable us to take advantage of lower Canadian tax rates in the years after the year of implementation to a greater extent than would likely have been available if the Redomicile Transaction was not completed, these benefits may not be achieved. In particular, tax authorities may challenge our application and/or interpretation of relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties, valuations and methodologies or other supporting documentation, and, if they are successful in doing so, we may not experience the level of benefits we anticipate or we may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Even if we are successful in maintaining our tax positions, we may incur significant expense in contesting these positions or other claims made by tax authorities. In addition, changes in tax laws or increased rates of tax could have the effect of negatively impacting our anticipated effective tax rates. Our effective tax rates and the benefits described herein are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in Canada, the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially as between Canadian and U.S. dollars), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of Canada, including changes in interest rates, withholding taxes, tax treaties and federal and provincial tax rates generally. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be (and, in fact, often seem to be) interrelated, and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.. 42. More specifically, Canada’s tax rules under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Canadian Tax Act) allow for favorable tax treatment insofar as the repatriation of certain dividends from foreign affiliates. These tax rules are complicated and could change over time. Any such changes could have a material impact on our overall tax rate.. Canada has also introduced tax rules governing “foreign affiliate dumping” in the Canadian Tax Act that can have adverse tax consequences for Canadian corporations that are controlled by non-Canadian corporations in respect of non-Canadian business activities and investments. These rules would have a negative impact on us to the extent that we became controlled by a non-Canadian resident corporation.. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may disagree with our conclusions on tax treatment and the CRA has not provided (and we have not requested) a ruling on the Canadian tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction.. Based on the current provisions of the Canadian Tax Act, we expect that the Redomicile Transaction will not result in any material Canadian federal income tax liability to us. However, if the CRA disagrees with this view, it may take the position that material Canadian federal income tax liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by us as a result of the Redomicile Transaction, in which case, we expect that we would contest such assessment. To contest such assessment, we would be required to remit cash equal to half of the amount in dispute, or provide security acceptable to the CRA, to prevent the CRA from seeking enforcement actions pending the dispute of such assessment. If we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could be materially adverse to us. The CRA has not provided (and we have not requested) a ruling on the Canadian tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction. There can be no assurance that the CRA will agree with our interpretation of the tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction or any related matters associated therewith.. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and no ruling has been sought from the IRS.. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation generally is considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation. Because we are a British Columbia incorporated entity, we generally will be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under U.S. federal income tax law. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code.. Under Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code, if the former stockholders of Civeo US hold 80% or more of the vote or value of our common shares by reason of holding stock in Civeo US (the ownership test), and our expanded affiliated group after the Redomicile Transaction does not have substantial business activities in Canada relative to its worldwide activities (the substantial business activities test), we would be treated as a U.S. corporation. For this purpose, “substantial business activities” generally requires at least 25% of the employees (by number and compensation), assets and gross income of our expanded affiliated group to be based, located and derived, respectively, in Canada (25% test).. We believe that we have satisfied this 25% test because Civeo US had significant operations in Canada prior to the Redomicile Transaction (with its remaining operations occurring in Australia and the United States), and we have continued these operations following the Redomicile Transaction. Therefore, under current U.S. federal income tax law, we believe that we will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If it were determined, however, that we should be taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income taxes.. 43. Future potential changes to U.S. tax laws could result in Civeo being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, Civeo is generally treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Changes to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code or the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof, could adversely affect Civeo’s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, members of Congress from time to time have proposed changes to the Internal Revenue Code, and the U.S. Treasury has taken and may continue to take regulatory action, in connection with so-called inversion transactions. The timing and substance of any such change in law or regulatory action is uncertain. Any such change of law or regulatory action could adversely impact the treatment of Civeo as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could adversely impact its tax position and financial position and results in a material manner. The precise scope and application of any legislative or regulatory proposals will not be clear until they are actually issued, and, accordingly, until such legislation or regulations are issued and fully understood, we cannot be certain as to their potential impact. Any such changes could apply retroactively to a date prior to the date of the Redomicile Transaction. If Civeo were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could be subject to substantially greater U.S. federal income tax liability.. We remain subject to changes in tax law and other factors that may not allow us to achieve a lower effective corporate tax rate.. While we believe that the Redomicile Transaction should allow for a lower effective corporate tax rate, we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be after the Redomicile Transaction because of, among other things, the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate, primarily Canada and Australia. Also, the tax laws of Canada, Australia and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective corporate tax rate. As a result, our actual effective tax rate may be materially different from our expectation. Our provision for income taxes will be based on certain estimates and assumptions made by management in consultation with our tax and other advisors. Our consolidated income tax rate will be affected by the amount of net income earned in Canada and our other operating jurisdictions, the availability of benefits under tax treaties, and the rates of taxes payable in respect of that income. We will enter into many transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course of business in respect of which the tax treatment is not entirely certain. We will therefore make estimates and judgments based on our knowledge and understanding of applicable tax laws and tax treaties, and the application of those tax laws and tax treaties to our business, in determining our consolidated tax provision. The final outcome of any audits by taxation authorities may differ from the estimates and assumptions we may use in determining our consolidated tax provisions and accruals. This could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated income tax provision, financial condition and the net income for the period in which such determinations are made.. Our tax position may be adversely affected by changes in tax law relating to multinational corporations, or increased scrutiny by tax authorities.. Recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence, to limit the ability of foreign-owned corporations to deduct interest expense, and to make other changes in the taxation of multinational corporations.. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is found in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting”, where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect us.. 44. Moreover, U.S. and international tax authorities may carefully scrutinize companies that have redomiciled, such as our company, which may lead such authorities to assert that we owe additional taxes.. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (U.S. Tax Reform) was signed into law, making significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  Changes include, but are not limited to, a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.  Many aspects of the new legislation are unclear and may not be clarified for some time.  As a result, we have made an estimate of the impact of the new laws on our business, operating results and financial condition.  It is possible that the U.S. Tax Reform, or interpretations under it, could have an adverse effect on us, and such effect could be material.. We may be subject to additional Canadian and British Columbia laws and regulations as a result of the Redomicile Transaction.. Now that we are a British Columbia company, we may be subject to additional Canadian and British Columbia laws and regulations, which can increase compliance costs for us and result in delays in future transactions we propose to complete.. Risks Related to the Spin-Off from Oil States. Our tax sharing agreement with Oil States may require us to indemnify Oil States for significant tax liabilities.. In connection with our spin-off from Oil States International, Inc. (Oil States) in May 2014 (the Spin-Off), we entered into a tax sharing agreement. Under the tax sharing agreement, we are required to indemnify Oil States against certain tax-related liabilities incurred by Oil States (including any of its subsidiaries) relating to the Spin-off, to the extent caused by our breach of any representations or covenants made in the tax sharing agreement or the separation and distribution agreement, or made in connection with the private letter ruling or the tax opinion obtained with respect to the Spin-off. These liabilities include the substantial tax-related liability (calculated without regard to any net operating loss or other tax attribute of Oil States) that would result if the Spin-off of our stock to Oil States stockholders failed to qualify as a tax-free transaction. In addition, we have agreed to pay 50% of any taxes arising from the Spin-off to the extent that the tax is not attributable to the fault of either party.. We could have significant tax liabilities for periods during which our subsidiaries and operations were those of Oil States.. For any tax periods (or portion thereof) in which Oil States owned at least 80% of the total voting power and value of Civeo US’s common stock, our U.S. subsidiaries will be included in Oil States’ consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, one or more of our U.S. subsidiaries may be included in the combined, consolidated or unitary tax returns of Oil States or one or more of its subsidiaries for U.S. state or local income tax purposes. Under the tax sharing agreement, for each period in which we or any of our subsidiaries are consolidated or combined with Oil States for purposes of any tax return, and with respect to which such tax return has not yet been filed, Oil States will prepare a pro forma tax return for us as if we filed our own consolidated, combined or unitary return, except that such pro forma tax return will generally include current income, deductions, credits and losses from us (with certain exceptions), will not include any carryovers or carrybacks of losses or credits and will be calculated without regard to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax. We will reimburse Oil States for any taxes shown on the pro forma tax returns, and Oil States will reimburse us for any current losses or credits we recognize based on the pro forma tax returns. In addition, by virtue of Oil States’ controlling ownership and the tax sharing agreement, Oil States will effectively control all of our U.S. tax decisions in connection with any consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which any of our subsidiaries are included. The tax sharing agreement provides that Oil States will have sole authority to respond to and conduct all tax proceedings (including tax audits) relating to us, to prepare and file all consolidated, combined or unitary income tax returns in which we are included on our behalf (including the making of any tax elections), and to determine the reimbursement amounts in connection with any pro forma tax returns. This arrangement may result in conflicts of interest between Oil States and us. For example, under the tax sharing agreement, Oil States will be able to choose to contest, compromise or settle any adjustment or deficiency proposed by the relevant taxing authority in a manner that may be beneficial to Oil States and detrimental to us; provided, however, that Oil States may not make any settlement that would materially increase our tax liability without our consent.. 45. Moreover, notwithstanding the tax sharing agreement, U.S. federal law provides that each member of a consolidated group is liable for the group’s entire tax obligation. Thus, to the extent Oil States or other members of Oil States’ consolidated group fail to make any U.S. federal income tax payments required by law, one or more of our U.S. subsidiaries could be liable for the shortfall with respect to periods in which such subsidiary was a member of Oil States’ consolidated group. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state or local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with Oil States or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state or local income tax purposes.. If there is a determination that the Spin-off is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings underlying the tax opinion are incorrect or for any other reason, then Oil States and its stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.. Oil States received a private letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion of its outside counsel regarding certain aspects of the Spin-off transaction. The private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Oil States and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are, or become, incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Oil States and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the private letter ruling or the opinion of its tax advisor and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, an opinion of counsel is not binding upon the IRS, so, notwithstanding the opinion of Oil States’ tax advisor, the IRS could conclude upon audit that the Spin-off is taxable in full or in part if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Oil States or us. If the Spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any reason, Oil States and/or its stockholders could incur significant income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.. Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Oil States that we did not assume in our agreements.. Third parties may seek to hold us responsible for retained liabilities of Oil States. Under our agreements with Oil States, Oil States agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to these retained liabilities. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from Oil States.. The Spin-Off may have exposed us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.. The Spin-off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Under these laws, if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (including without limitation a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries) were to determine that Oil States or any of its subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for distributing shares of our common stock or taking other action as part of the Spin-Off, or that we or any of our subsidiaries did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring indebtedness, including the debt incurred by us in connection with the Spin-off, transferring assets or taking other action as part of the Spin-off and, at the time of such action, we, Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries (i) was insolvent or would be rendered insolvent, (ii) had reasonably small capital with which to carry on its business and all business in which it intended to engage or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they would mature, then such court could void the Spin-off as a constructive fraudulent transfer. If such court made this determination, the court could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, voiding our liens and claims against Oil States, or providing Oil States with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Oil States and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-Off.. 46. The measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction’s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than (i) the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or (ii) the amount that will be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they become absolute and mature. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, Oil States or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off, including the distribution of shares of our common stock.. Under the separation and distribution agreement, Oil States is and we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which Oil States and we, respectively, own and operate following the Spin-Off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any such obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, it is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Oil States, particularly if Oil States were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the subject allocated obligations.. Risks Related to Our Common Shares. If we cannot meet the NYSE continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common shares.. Our common shares are currently listed on the NYSE, and the continued listing of our common shares is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with these continued listing standards, our common shares may be delisted. A delisting of our common shares could negatively impact us by, among other things:. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treducing the liquidity and market price of our common shares;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\treducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common shares, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdecreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us;. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and. <U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\timpacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our ability to attract new business.. The market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile.. The market price of our common shares has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, during 2016, the market price of our common shares ranged from a low of $0.75 per share to a high of $2.81 per share, and during 2017, the market price of our common shares ranged from a low of $1.57 per share to a high of $3.73 per share.  From January 1, 2018 to February 19, 2018, the market price of our common shares has ranged between a low of $2.74 per share to a high of $3.81 per share. The market price of our common shares may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:. <U+25CF> \t\t\tchanges in financial estimates by analysts and our inability to meet those financial estimates; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tstrategic actions by us or our competitors; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tvariations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors; \t\t\t \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tgeneral economic and stock market conditions; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\trisks related to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;. 47. <U+25CF> \t\t\tchanges in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\t \t\t\tterrorist acts; \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tfuture sales of our common shares or other securities by us, members of our management team or our existing shareholders; and \t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t\t  \t\t  \t\t\t<U+25CF> \t\t\tinvestor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common shares relative to other investment alternatives.. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common shares is low.. Our financial position, cash flows, results of operations and share price could be materially adversely affected if commodity prices do not improve or decline further. In addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons potentially unrelated to their operating performance. Our share price may experience substantial volatility due to uncertainty regarding commodity prices. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our share price, regardless of our operating results.. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common shares or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our share price could decline.. The trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.. We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common shares.. We currently do not pay dividends. The declaration and amount of all dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements of our business, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors the board of directors deems relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common shares is limited by covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement. Future agreements may also limit our ability to pay dividends. If we elect to pay dividends in the future, the amount per share of our dividend payments may be changed, or dividends may again be suspended, without advance notice. The likelihood that dividends will be reduced or suspended is increased during periods of market weakness. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this annual report. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.. Provisions contained in our articles and applicable Canadian and British Columbia laws could discourage a take-over attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium.. Provisions contained in our articles provide for a classified board of directors, limitations on the removal of directors, limitations on shareholder proposals at meetings of shareholders and limitations on shareholder action by written consent, which could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. Our articles, subject to the corporate law of British Columbia, also authorize our board of directors to issue series of preferred shares without shareholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred shares, it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our shareholders’ ability to sell their common shares at a premium. In addition, in Canada, we may become subject to applicable securities laws, including National Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids of the Canadian Securities Administrators, which provide a heightened threshold for shareholder acceptance of third-party acquisition offers and could discourage take-over attempts that could result in a premium over the market price for our common shares.. 48. As a British Columbia company, we may be subject to additional Canadian laws and regulations. The application of additional Canadian laws and regulations could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire control of us. For example, such laws and regulations may, depending on the circumstances, result in regulatory reviews of and may require regulatory approval for any proposed take-over attempts.. Any of the foregoing could prevent or delay a change of control and may deprive or limit strategic opportunities for our shareholders to sell their common shares and/or affect the market price of our common shares.. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.. Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, share repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. It is possible activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist shareholders or others in the future would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our revenue, earnings and operating cash flows could be adversely affected.. We are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States.. There are material differences between the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (BCBCA) as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL). For example, some of these material differences include the following: (a) for material corporate transactions (such as amalgamations, arrangements, the sale of all or substantially all of our undertaking, and other extraordinary corporate transactions) the BCBCA, subject to the provisions of our Articles, generally requires two-thirds majority vote by shareholders, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders for similar material corporate transactions; and (b) under the BCBCA a holder of 5% or more of our common shares can requisition a general meeting of shareholders for the purpose of transacting any business that may be transacted at a general meeting, whereas the DGCL does not give this right. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because of these material differences. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile."
