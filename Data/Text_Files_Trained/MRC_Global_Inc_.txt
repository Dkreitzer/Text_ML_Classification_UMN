[1] "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. You should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other risks and uncertainties contained in this Annual Report on  Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings.  The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context expressly requires a different reading, when we state that a factor could \"adversely affect us,\"  have a \"material adverse effect,\" \"adversely affect our business\" and similar expressions, we mean that the factor could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,  operating results and cash flows. Information contained in this section may be considered \"forward-looking statements.\" See \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" for a discussion of certain qualifications regarding forward looking statements.. Risks Related to Our Business. Decreased capital and other expenditures in the energy industry, which can result from decreased oil and natural gas prices, among other things, can adversely impact our customers' demand for our products and our revenue.. A large portion of our revenue depends upon the level of capital and operating expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry, including capital and other expenditures in connection with exploration, drilling, production, gathering, transportation, refining and processing operations. Demand for the products we distribute and services we provide is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital and other expenditures by, oil and natural gas companies. A material decline in oil or natural gas prices, inability to access capital, and consolidation within the industry could all depress levels of exploration, development and production activity and, therefore, could lead to a decrease in our customers' capital and other expenditures. If our customers' expenditures decline, our business will suffer.. Volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for our products.. As evidenced by the decline of oil prices from late 2014 through 2016, prices for oil and natural gas are cyclical and subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Any sustained decrease in capital expenditures in the oil and natural gas industry could have a material adverse effect on us.. Many factors affect the supply of and demand for energy and, therefore, influence oil and natural gas prices, including:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of domestic and worldwide oil and natural gas production and inventories;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe level of drilling activity and the availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects, which governmental actions may affect, such as regulatory actions or legislation, or other restrictions on drilling, including those related to environmental concerns;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves and the expected cost of developing new reserves;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe actual cost of finding and producing oil and natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdepletion rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdomestic and worldwide refinery overcapacity or undercapacity and utilization rates;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe availability of transportation infrastructure and refining capacity;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in the cost of products and services that the oil and gas industry uses, such as those that we provide, which may result from increases in the cost of raw materials such as steel;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tshifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe economic or political attractiveness of alternative fuels, such as coal, hydrocarbon, wind, solar energy and biomass-based fuels;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreases in oil and natural gas prices or historically high oil and natural gas prices, which could lower demand for oil and natural gas products;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tworldwide economic activity including growth in non-OECD countries, including (among others) China and India;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinterest rates and the cost of capital;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tnational government policies, including government policies that could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration, production, refining or transportation assets;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") along with other countries, such as Russia, to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe impact of armed hostilities, or the threat or perception of armed hostilities;. 8.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenvironmental regulation and policies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttechnological advances;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcurrency fluctuations; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttax policies.. Oil and natural gas prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. This volatility has historically caused oil and natural gas companies to change their strategies and expenditure levels from year to year. We have experienced in the past, and we will likely experience in the future, significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes. In particular, volatility in the oil and natural gas sectors could adversely affect our business.. General economic conditions may adversely affect our business.. U.S. and global general economic conditions affect many aspects of our business, including demand for the products we distribute and the pricing and availability of supplies. General economic conditions and predictions regarding future economic conditions also affect our forecasts. A decrease in demand for the products we distribute or other adverse effects resulting from an economic downturn may cause us to fail to achieve our anticipated financial results. General economic factors beyond our control that affect our business and customers include interest rates, recession, inflation, deflation, customer credit availability, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, performance of housing markets, energy costs, tax rates and policy, unemployment rates, commencement or escalation of war or hostilities, the threat or possibility of war, terrorism or other global or national unrest, political or financial instability and other matters that influence our customers' spending. Increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency or increase in magnitude. In addition, worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows going forward. Continued adverse economic conditions would have an adverse effect on us.. We may be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry.. We sell products and services in very competitive markets. In some cases, we compete with large companies with substantial resources. In other cases, we compete with smaller regional players that may increasingly be willing to provide similar products and services at lower prices. Competitive actions, such as price reductions, consolidation in the industry, improved delivery and other actions, could adversely affect our revenue and earnings. We could experience a material adverse effect to the extent that our competitors are successful in reducing our customers' purchases of products and services from us. Competition could also cause us to lower our prices, which could reduce our margins and profitability. Furthermore, consolidation in our industry could heighten the impacts of the competition on our business and results of operations discussed above, particularly if consolidation results in competitors with stronger financial and strategic resources and could also result in increases to the prices we are required to pay for acquisitions we may make in the future.. Demand for the products we distribute could decrease if the manufacturers of those products were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the sectors we serve.. Historically, users of PVF and related products have purchased certain amounts of these products through distributors and not directly from manufacturers. If customers were to purchase the products that we sell directly from manufacturers, or if manufacturers sought to increase their efforts to sell directly to end users, we could experience a significant decrease in profitability. These or other developments that remove us from, or limit our role in, the distribution chain, may harm our competitive position in the marketplace, reduce our sales and earnings and adversely affect our business.. We may experience unexpected supply shortages.. We distribute products from a wide variety of manufacturers and suppliers. Nevertheless, in the future we may have difficulty obtaining the products we need from suppliers and manufacturers as a result of unexpected demand or production difficulties that might extend lead times. Also, products may not be available to us in quantities sufficient to meet our customer demand. Our inability to obtain products from suppliers and manufacturers in sufficient quantities, or at all, could adversely affect our product offerings and our business.. We may experience cost increases from suppliers, which we may be unable to pass on to our customers.. In the future, we may face supply cost increases due to, among other things, unexpected increases in demand for supplies, decreases in production of supplies, increases in the cost of raw materials, transportation, changes in exchange rates or the imposition of import taxes or tariff on imported products. Any inability to pass supply price increases on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, we may be unable to pass increased supply costs on to our customers because significant amounts of our. 9. sales are derived from stocking program arrangements, contracts and maintenance and repair arrangements, which provide our customers time limited price protection, which may obligate us to sell products at a set price for a specific period. In addition, if supply costs increase, our customers may elect to purchase smaller amounts of products or may purchase products from other distributors. While we may be able to work with our customers to reduce the effects of unforeseen price increases because of our relationships with them, we may not be able to reduce the effects of the cost increases. In addition, to the extent that competition leads to reduced purchases of products or services from us or a reduction of our prices, and these reductions occur concurrently with increases in the prices for selected commodities which we use in our operations, including steel, nickel and molybdenum, the adverse effects described above would likely be exacerbated and could result in a prolonged downturn in profitability.. We do not have contracts with most of our suppliers. The loss of a significant supplier would require us to rely more heavily on our other existing suppliers or to develop relationships with new suppliers. Such a loss may have an adverse effect on our product offerings and our business.. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we do not have contracts with most of our suppliers. We generally make our purchases through purchase orders. Therefore, most of our suppliers have the ability to terminate their relationships with us at any time. Approximately 43% of our total purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017 were from our 25 largest suppliers. Although we believe there are numerous manufacturers with the capacity to supply the products we distribute, the loss of one or more of our major suppliers could have an adverse effect on our product offerings and our business. Such a loss would require us to rely more heavily on our other existing suppliers or develop relationships with new suppliers, which may cause us to pay higher prices for products due to, among other things, a loss of volume discount benefits currently obtained from our major suppliers.. Price reductions by suppliers of products that we sell could cause the value of our inventory to decline. Also, these price reductions could cause our customers to demand lower sales prices for these products, possibly decreasing our margins and profitability on sales to the extent that we purchased our inventory of these products at the higher prices prior to supplier price reductions.. The value of our inventory could decline as a result of manufacturer price reductions with respect to products that we sell. There is no assurance that a substantial decline in product prices would not result in a write-down of our inventory value. Such a write-down could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.. Also, decreases in the market prices of products that we sell could cause customers to demand lower sales prices from us. These price reductions could reduce our margins and profitability on sales with respect to the lower-priced products. Reductions in our margins and profitability on sales could have a material adverse effect on us.. A substantial decrease in the price of steel could significantly lower our gross profit or cash flow.. We distribute many products manufactured from steel. As a result, the price and supply of steel can affect our business and, in particular, our carbon steel line pipe product category. When steel prices are lower, the prices that we charge customers for products may decline, which affects our gross profit and cash flow. At times pricing and availability of steel can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, sales levels, competition, consolidation of steel producers, fluctuations in and the costs of raw materials necessary to produce steel, steel manufacturers' plant utilization levels and capacities, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. Increases in manufacturing capacity for the carbon steel line pipe products could put pressure on the prices we receive for our carbon steel line pipe products. When steel prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors' responses to those demands could result in lower sales prices and, consequently, lower gross profit and cash flow.. If steel prices rise, we may be unable to pass along the cost increases to our customers.. We maintain inventories of steel products to accommodate the lead time requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase steel products in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, contracts with customers and market conditions. Our commitments to purchase steel products are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. If steel prices increase between the time we order steel products and the time of delivery of the products to us, our suppliers may impose surcharges that require us to pay for increases in steel prices during the period. Demand for the products we distribute, the actions of our competitors and other factors will influence whether we will be able to pass on steel cost increases and surcharges to our customers, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so.. 10. We do not have long-term contracts or agreements with many of our customers. The contracts and agreements that we do have generally do not commit our customers to any minimum purchase volume. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we do not have long-term contracts with many of our customers. In addition, our contracts, including our maintenance, repair and operations (\"MRO\") contracts, generally do not commit our customers to any minimum purchase volume. Therefore, a significant number of our customers, including our MRO customers, may terminate their relationships with us or reduce their purchasing volume at any time. Furthermore, the long-term customer contracts that we do have are generally terminable without cause on short notice. Our 25 largest customers represented approximately 53% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The products that we may sell to any particular customer depend in large part on the size of that customer's capital expenditure budget in a particular year and on the results of competitive bids for major projects. Consequently, a customer that accounts for a significant portion of our sales in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of our sales in subsequent fiscal years. The loss of a significant customer, or a substantial decrease in a significant customer's orders, may have an adverse effect on our sales and revenue.  In addition, we are subject to customer audit clauses in many of our multi-year contracts. If we are not able to provide the proper documentation or support for invoices per the contract terms, we may be subject to negotiated settlements with our major customers.. Changes in our customer and product mix could cause our gross profit percentage to fluctuate.. From time to time, we may experience changes in our customer mix or in our product mix. Changes in our customer mix may result from geographic expansion, daily selling activities within current geographic markets and targeted selling activities to new customer segments. Changes in our product mix may result from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers. If customers begin to require more lower-margin products from us and fewer higher-margin products, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer.. Customer credit risks could result in losses.. The concentration of our customers in the energy industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by prolonged changes in economic and industry conditions. Further, laws in some jurisdictions in which we operate could make collection difficult or time consuming. In addition, in times when commodity prices are low, our customers with higher debt levels may not have the ability to pay their debts.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for expected credit losses, we cannot assure these reserves will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations.. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions.. One of our key operating strategies is to selectively pursue acquisitions, including large scale acquisitions, to continue to grow and increase profitability. However, acquisitions, particularly of a significant scale, involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions in the future, increased leverage due to additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, dilution of our stockholders' net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms, assumption of undisclosed or unknown liabilities and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions. In addition, any future acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and risks associated with entry into new markets.. Even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tstrain on the operational and managerial controls and procedures of our business, and the need to modify systems or to add management resources;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdifficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tamortization of acquired assets, which would reduce future reported earnings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tpossible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tdiversion of management's attention from the ongoing operations of our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tintegrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tcoordinating sales and marketing functions;. 11.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfailure to obtain and retain key personnel of an acquired business; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tassumption of known or unknown material liabilities or regulatory non-compliance issues.. Failure to manage these acquisition growth risks could have an adverse effect on us.. Our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on us.. We have now and will likely continue to have indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, we had total debt outstanding of  $526 million and excess availability of $437 million under our credit facilities. We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness, the risks described below could increase. Our significant level of indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, acquisitions, expenditures, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tsubjecting us to restrictive financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing our and our subsidiaries' long-term indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in our or our subsidiaries' debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of our products; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tlimiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in our industry and in our customers' industries.. In addition, borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was  $31 million.. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets, properties and systems software, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may seek to sell assets to fund our liquidity needs but may not be able to do so. We may also need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.. In addition, we are and will be subject to covenants contained in agreements governing our present and future indebtedness. These covenants include and will likely include restrictions on:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tinvestments, including acquisitions;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tprepayment of certain indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe granting of liens;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe incurrence of additional indebtedness;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tasset sales;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe making of fundamental changes to our business;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\ttransactions with affiliates; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe payment of dividends.. In addition, any defaults under our credit facilities, including our global asset-based lending facility (\"Global ABL Facility\"), our senior secured term loan B (\"Term Loan\") or our other debt could trigger cross defaults under other or future credit agreements and may permit acceleration of our other indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. For a description of our credit facilities and indebtedness, see \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\".. 12. We are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flow.. We are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or to pay dividends or make other distributions in the future will depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries' payment of funds to us in the form of dividends, tax sharing payments or otherwise.. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings, the terms of their current and future indebtedness, tax considerations and legal and contractual restrictions on the ability to make distributions. In particular, our subsidiaries' credit facilities currently impose limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us and consequently our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Subject to limitations in our credit facilities, our subsidiaries may also enter into additional agreements that contain covenants prohibiting them from distributing or advancing funds or transferring assets to us under certain circumstances, including to pay dividends.. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Any right that we have to receive any assets of or distributions from any of our subsidiaries upon the bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization, or to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets, will be junior to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt that the subsidiary issued.. Changes in our credit profile may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.. Changes in our credit profile may affect the way our suppliers view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices if they perceive our indebtedness to be high. Given the large dollar amounts and volume of our purchases from suppliers, a change in payment terms may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers and, consequently, may have a material adverse effect on us.. If tariffs and duties on imports into the U.S. of certain of the products that we sell are lifted or imposed, we could have too many of these products in inventory competing against less expensive imports or conversely pay higher prices for products that we sell.. U.S. law currently imposes tariffs and duties on imports from certain foreign countries of line pipe and, to a lesser extent, on imports of certain other products that we sell. If these tariffs and duties are lifted or reduced or if the level of these imported products otherwise increase, and our U.S. customers accept these imported products, we could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that we would then have higher-cost products in our inventory or experience lower prices and margins due to increased supplies of these products that could drive down prices and margins. If prices of these products were to decrease significantly, we might not be able to profitably sell these products, and the value of our inventory would decline. In addition, significant price decreases could result in a significantly longer holding period for some of our inventory.  Conversely, if tariffs and duties are imposed on imports from certain foreign countries of products that we sell, we could be required to pay higher prices for our products.  Demand for the products we distribute, the actions of our competitors and other factors will influence whether we will be able to pass on additional cost increases to our customers, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so.. We are subject to strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may lead to significant liabilities and negatively impact the demand for our products.. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements (collectively, \"environmental laws\"), including those governing the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe discharge of pollutants or hazardous substances into the air, soil or water;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe generation, handling, use, management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe responsibility to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\toccupational health and safety.. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, employee, neighbor or other third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.. Certain environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law or its state or foreign equivalents, may impose the obligation to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination at a facility on current and former owners, lessees or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal.  These environmental laws may impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Although we are not aware of any active litigation against us under the U.S. federal Superfund law or its state or foreign equivalents, we have identified contamination at several of our current and former facilities, and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up these conditions. Moreover, we may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future owned or leased sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed. 13. or acquired. We believe that indemnities contained in certain of our acquisition agreements may cover certain environmental conditions existing at the time of the acquisition subject to certain terms, limitations and conditions. However, if these indemnification provisions terminate or if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their indemnification obligations, we may be subject to liability with respect to the environmental matters that those indemnification provisions address.  Although our responsibility for the clean-up of contamination or pollution to date has not been material, were there to be a significant release of contamination or pollution related to our operations, our obligation to clean up that contamination or pollution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. Certain governments at the international, national, regional and state level are at various stages of considering or implementing treaties and environmental laws that could limit emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, associated with the burning of fossil fuels.  It is not possible to predict how new environmental laws to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business or that of our customers, but these laws and regulations could impose costs on us or negatively impact the market for the products we distribute and, consequently, our business.. <U+FEFF>. In addition, federal, state, local, foreign and provincial governments have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, environmental laws that could impose more stringent permitting; disclosure; wastewater and other waste disposal; greenhouse gas, ethane or volatile organic compound control, leak detection and repair requirements;  and well construction and testing requirements on our customers' hydraulic fracturing.. Environmental laws applicable to our business and the business of our customers, including environmental laws regulating the energy industry, and the interpretation or enforcement of these environmental laws, are constantly evolving; it is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these environmental laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Should environmental laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs, or the costs of our customers, could increase, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.. We may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities, including liabilities arising from litigation.. In the ordinary course of business, we have and in the future may become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, the products we distribute, employees and other matters, including potential claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of the products we distribute or our operations. Some of these claims may relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of the businesses. The products we distribute are sold primarily for use in the energy industry, which is subject to inherent risks that could result in death, personal injury, property damage, pollution, release of hazardous substances or loss of production. In addition, defects in the products we distribute could result in death, personal injury, property damage, pollution, release of hazardous substances or damage to equipment and facilities. Actual or claimed defects in the products we distribute may give rise to claims against us for losses and expose us to claims for damages.. We maintain insurance to cover certain of our potential losses, and we are subject to various self-insured retentions, deductibles and caps under our insurance. It is possible, however, that judgments could be rendered against us in cases in which we would be uninsured and beyond the amounts of insurance we have or beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for these matters. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms in the future, and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage. Even in cases where we maintain insurance coverage, our insurers may raise various objections and exceptions to coverage that could make uncertain the timing and amount of any possible insurance recovery. Finally, while we may have insurance coverage, we cannot guarantee that the insurance carrier will have the financial wherewithal to pay a claim otherwise covered by insurance, and as a result we may be responsible for any such claims.. Due to our position as a distributor, we are subject to personal injury, product liability and environmental claims involving allegedly defective products.. Our customers use certain of the products we distribute in potentially hazardous applications that can result in personal injury, product liability and environmental claims. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where end users use the products we distribute may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims, even though we did not manufacture the products. Applicable law may render us liable for damages without regard to negligence or fault. In particular, certain environmental laws provide for joint and several and strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. Certain of these risks are reduced by the fact that we are a distributor of products that third-party manufacturers produce, and, thus, in certain circumstances, we may have third-party warranty or other claims against the manufacturer of products alleged to have been defective. However, there is no assurance that these claims could fully protect us or that the manufacturer would be able financially to provide protection. There is no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover or be adequate to cover the underlying claims. Our insurance does not provide. 14. coverage for all liabilities (including but not limited to liability for certain events involving pollution or other environmental claims).  Our insurance does not cover damages from breach of contract by us or based on alleged fraud or deceptive trade practices.. We are a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits. Exposure to these and any future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us.. We are a defendant in lawsuits involving approximately 1,153 claims, arising from exposure to asbestos-containing materials included in products that we distributed in the past. Each claim involves allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing materials by a single individual, his or her spouse or family members. The complaints in these lawsuits typically name many other defendants. In the majority of these lawsuits, little or no information is known regarding the nature of the plaintiffs' alleged injuries or their connection with the products we distributed. Based on our experience with asbestos litigation to date, as well as the existence of certain insurance coverage, we do not believe that the outcome of these pending claims will have a material impact on us. However, the potential liability associated with asbestos claims is subject to many uncertainties, including negative trends with respect to settlement payments, dismissal rates and the types of medical conditions alleged in pending or future claims, negative developments in the claims pending against us, the current or future insolvency of co-defendants, adverse changes in relevant laws or the interpretation of those laws and the extent to which insurance will be available to pay for defense costs, judgments or settlements. Further, while we anticipate that additional claims will be filed against us in the future, we are unable to predict with any certainty the number, timing and magnitude of future claims. Therefore, we can give no assurance that pending or future asbestos litigation will not ultimately have a material adverse effect on us. See \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings\" and \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\" for more information.. If we lose any of our key personnel, we may be unable to effectively manage our business or continue our growth.. Our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, we rely on our sales and marketing teams to create innovative ways to generate demand for the products we distribute. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our management team or a key sales or marketing employee could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent we are unable to timely find adequate replacements. We face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting, hiring, training and retaining qualified personnel.. Interruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs or decreases in revenue.. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. We depend on our information management systems to process orders, track credit risk, manage inventory and monitor accounts receivable collections. Our information systems also allow us to efficiently purchase products from our vendors and ship products to our customers on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations and provide superior service to our customers. However, our information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures, cyber incidents and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our ability to procure products to sell, process and ship customer orders, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay accounts payable and expenses could be adversely affected. In addition, the cost to repair, modify or replace all or part of our information systems or consolidate one or more systems onto one information technology platform, whether by necessity or choice, would require a significant cash investment on the part of the Company. Our ability to integrate our systems with our customers' systems would also be significantly affected. We maintain information systems controls designed to protect against, among other things, unauthorized program changes and unauthorized access to data on our information systems. If our information systems controls do not function properly, we face increased risks of unexpected errors and unreliable financial data or theft of proprietary Company information.. The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information or damage to our Company's image or reputation, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our Company's reputation and image and private data exposure. We have implemented hardware and software solutions, processes, training and procedures to help mitigate this risk, but these measures, as well as our organization's increased awareness of our risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results and operations will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.  While we also have some insurance to protect against the financial damage that a cyber incident could cause, there can be no guarantee that the insurance would be adequate for every type of incident to protect against the financial damages that could occur.  In some incidents, the Company may be required to shut off its. 15. computer systems, reboot them and reestablish its information from back up tapes.  In other incidents, the Company may be required under various laws to notify any third parties whose data has been compromised.  These incidents can adversely affect us.. Among others, cyber incidents could include the following:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tDenial of service attacks, whereby third parties attempt to slow down or shut down our computer systems by overloading information interfaces, which in turn, could interrupt our operations..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tComputer virus software that infects our computer systems to either allow third parties unauthorized access to private, confidential data or denies the Company access from its own information, often for the attacker's financial gain by demanding a ransom..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tTheft of private information.  An unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential supplier, customer or Company information or employee information could cause a theft or unwanted disclosure of data..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tE-mail or other forms of spoofing or \"phishing\" whereby third parties attempt to trick or induce employees to provide private information, such as passwords, social security numbers or other identifying information, to allow the third party to fraudulently attempt to invoice the Company or gain access to the Company's computer systems..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tIntrusion into payment systems.  The Company does not generally accept credit cards for payment as most of its customers are industrial and energy companies who provide payment through invoicing processes.  Even so, a portion of our payment methods also subject us to potential fraud and theft by criminals, who are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tSupplier or customer cyber incidents.  Our suppliers and customers also rely upon computer information systems to operate their respective businesses.  If any of them experience a cyber incident, this could adversely impact their operations.  Suppliers could delay providing product to us for our distribution to our customers.  Customers, especially those who do business with us through electronic data interchanges, could be negatively impacted by cyber incidents applicable to them, which, could slow order processing from them or payments to us..  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tCyber incidents applicable to outsourced information systems.  We outsource the operations of a significant portion of our computer information systems to third party service providers, which store our information on hosted or cloud systems.  Although we review their security precautions with them and attempt to hold them contractually responsible for cyber incidents applicable to our information on their systems, there can be no assurance that these vendors will maintain adequate security to stop an incident, inform us of an incident in a timely manner or perform as required in the their agreements.. The loss of third-party transportation providers upon whom we depend, or conditions negatively affecting the transportation industry, could increase our costs or cause a disruption in our operations.. We depend upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of products to our customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, among others, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, increases in fuel prices and adverse weather conditions, could increase our costs and disrupt our operations and our ability to service our customers on a timely basis. We cannot predict whether or to what extent increases or anticipated increases in fuel prices may impact our costs or cause a disruption in our operations going forward.. We may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.. We may require more capital in the future to:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfund our operations;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfinance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain and expand our distribution capabilities;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tenhance and expand the range of products we offer; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trespond to potential strategic opportunities, such as investments, acquisitions and international expansion.. We can give no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. The terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be forced to reduce our operations or delay, limit or abandon expansion opportunities. Moreover, even if we are able to continue our operations, the failure to obtain additional financing could reduce our competitiveness.. Adverse weather events or natural disasters could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations.. Certain areas in which we operate have been susceptible to more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods and to natural disasters such as earthquakes. These events can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. Additionally, we may experience communication. 16. disruptions with our customers, vendors and employees. These events can cause physical damage to our branches and require us to close branches. Additionally, our sales order backlog and shipments can experience a temporary decline immediately following these events.. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by these events will affect our operations or the economies in regions where we operate. These adverse events could result in disruption of our purchasing or distribution capabilities, interruption of our business that exceeds our insurance coverage, our inability to collect from customers and increased operating costs. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of these events.. We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet, partly because of acquisitions and business combination transactions. The amortization of acquired intangible assets will reduce our future reported earnings. Furthermore, if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to recognize non-cash charges that would reduce our income.. As of December 31, 2017, we had  $854 million of goodwill and other intangibles recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. A substantial portion of these intangible assets results from our use of purchase accounting in connection with the acquisitions we have made over the past several years. In accordance with the purchase accounting method, the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets is assigned to goodwill. The amortization expense associated with our identifiable intangible assets will have a negative effect on our future reported earnings. Many other companies, including many of our competitors, may not have the significant acquired intangible assets that we have because they may not have participated in recent acquisitions and business combination transactions similar to ours. Thus, the amortization of identifiable intangible assets may not negatively affect their reported earnings to the same degree as ours.. Additionally, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill and certain other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually, or more often in certain circumstances where events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable. These reviews could result in an earnings charge for impairment, which would reduce our net income even though there would be no impact on our underlying cash flow.. We face risks associated with conducting business in markets outside of North America.. We currently conduct substantial business in countries outside of North America. In addition, we are evaluating the possibility of establishing distribution networks in certain other foreign countries, particularly in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America. We could be materially and adversely affected by economic, legal, political and regulatory developments in the countries in which we do business in the future or in which we expand our business, particularly those countries which have historically experienced a high degree of political or economic instability. Examples of risks inherent in such non-North American activities include:.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including civil uprisings and terrorist acts;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tchanges in tariffs;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe adoption of foreign or domestic laws limiting exports to or imports from certain foreign countries;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tfluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\trestrictions on repatriation of earnings;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\texpropriation of property without fair compensation;.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tgovernmental actions that result in the deprivation of contract or proprietary rights; and.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\tthe acceptance of business practices which are not consistent with or are antithetical to prevailing business practices we are accustomed to in North America including export compliance and anti-bribery practices and governmental sanctions.. If we begin doing business in a foreign country in which we do not presently operate, we may also face difficulties in operations and diversion of management time in connection with establishing our business there.. We are subject to U.S. and other anti-corruption laws, trade controls, economic sanctions, and similar laws and regulations, including those in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties and harm our reputation.. Doing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury. 17. Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"). As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations.. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. It also requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the Company's transactions. As part of our business, we may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. In addition, the provisions of the United Kingdom Bribery Act (the \"Bribery Act\") extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also apply to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have higher than normal levels of corruption. Our continued expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future.. Economic sanctions programs restrict our business dealings with certain sanctioned countries, persons and entities. In addition, because we act as a distributor, we face the risk that our customers might further distribute our products to a sanctioned person or entity, or an ultimate end-user in a sanctioned country, which might subject us to an investigation concerning compliance with OFAC or other sanctions regulations.. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist our compliance with applicable U.S. and international anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the Bribery Act and trade controls and sanctions programs that OFAC administers, and have trained our employees to comply with these laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, consultants, agents or other associated persons will not take actions in violation of our policies and these laws and regulations, and that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage or provide a defense to any alleged violation. In particular, we may be held liable for the actions that our local, strategic or joint venture partners take inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Such a violation, even if our policies prohibit it, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business with sanctioned countries, persons and entities, which could adversely affect the market for our common stock and other securities.. We face risks associated with international instability and geopolitical developments.. In some countries, there is an increased chance for economic, legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or repatriation of our profits. We do not know the impact that these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may have on our business in the future and any of these factors could adversely affect us.. We are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\").. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to annually evaluate our internal controls systems over financial reporting. This is not a static process as we may change our processes each year or acquire new companies that have different controls than our existing controls. Upon completion of this process each year, we may identify control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\") rules and regulations that remain unremediated. We are required to report, among other things, control deficiencies that constitute a \"material weakness\" or changes in internal controls that, or that are reasonably likely to, materially affect internal controls over financial reporting. A \"material weakness\" is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.. We could suffer a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal controls, if we do not develop and maintain effective controls and procedures or if we are otherwise unable to deliver timely and reliable financial information. Any loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements or other negative reaction to our failure to develop timely or adequate disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. In addition, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.. 18. We do not currently intend to pay dividends to our common stockholders in the foreseeable future.. It is uncertain when, if ever, we will declare dividends to our common stockholders. We do not currently intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends is constrained by our holding company structure under which we are dependent on our subsidiaries for payments. Additionally, we and our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements which restrict our ability and their ability to pay dividends. See \"Item 5 - Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" and \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\".. Compliance with and changes in laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate could have a significant financial impact and affect how and where we conduct our operations.. We have operations in the U.S. and in 21 countries.  Expected and unexpected changes in the business and legal environments in the countries in which we operate can impact us. Compliance with and changes in laws, regulations and other legal and business issues could impact our ability to manage our costs and to meet our earnings goals. Compliance related matters could also limit our ability to do business in certain countries. Changes that could have a significant cost to us include new legislation, new regulations, or a differing interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in tax law or tax rates, the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits by various taxing authorities, changes in trade and other treaties that lead to differing tariffs and trade rules, the expansion of currency exchange controls, export controls or additional restrictions on doing business in countries subject to sanctions in which we operate or intend to operate.  For instance, we have provisionally accounted for changes from the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; however, this provisional accounting is subject to change based on our continued assessment of the impact of the law and any changes by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department on the interpretation and application of the law.  Similarly, the European Union and its constituent countries have recently implemented the General Data Protection Regulation, which is applicable to certain European countries in which we operate.  Changing law and regulation can impact our operations and adversely affect us."
