[1] "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS. In this section we describe what we believe to be the material risks related to our business. The risks and uncertainties described below or elsewhere in this report are not the only ones to which we are exposed. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known and/or risks we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business and operations. If any of the developments included in the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially adversely affected.. The cyclical nature of our business causes fluctuations in our operating results.. The machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly in the geographic markets we serve. As a result of this cyclicality, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our sales, which, in periods of reduced demand, have adversely affected our results of operations and financial condition, which could re-occur in the future.. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely affect overall demand.. We typically sell the majority of our larger high-performance VMX machines in Europe, which makes us particularly sensitive to economic and market conditions in that region. Economic uncertainty and business downturns in the U.S., European and Asian Pacific markets adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.. Our international operations pose additional risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings.. During fiscal 2017, approximately 71% of our revenues were derived from sales to customers located outside of the U.S. In addition, our main manufacturing facilities are located outside of the U.S. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:. •     trade     barriers;      •     regional     economic uncertainty;      •     differing     labor regulation;      •     governmental     expropriation;      •     domestic     and foreign customs and tariffs;      •     current     and changing regulatory environments affecting the importation and exportation of products and raw materials;      •     difficulty     in obtaining distribution support;      •     difficulty     in staffing and managing widespread operations;      •     differences     in the availability and terms of financing;      •     political     instability and unrest;       •     negative or unforeseen consequences resulting from the introduction, termination, modification, or renegotiation of international trade agreements or treaties;          •     changes     in tax regulations and rates in foreign countries; and      •     changes     in the European Union and Asia may adversely affect business activity and economic conditions globally and could continue     to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, as well as disrupting the free movement of     goods, services and people between countries.. Quotas, tariffs, taxes or other trade barriers could require us to change manufacturing sources, reduce prices, increase spending on marketing or product development, withdraw from or not enter certain markets or otherwise take actions that could be adverse to us. Also, in some foreign jurisdictions, we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met. These factors may adversely affect our future operating results. The vast majority of our products are shipped from our manufacturing facility in Taiwan from the Port of Taichung to four ports of destination: Los Angeles, California, Tacoma, Washington, Venlo, the Netherlands, and Shanghai, China. Changes in customs requirements, as a result of national security or other constraints put upon these ports, may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.. 14. Additionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially adversely affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents in foreign countries will not violate our policies.. We depend on limited sources for our products.. We depend on our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HML, Ningbo Hurco Manufacturing Limited, Milltronics, and LCM, to produce our machine tools and electro-mechanical components and accessories in Taiwan, China, the U.S. and Italy, respectively. We also depend on our 35% owned affiliate, HAL, and other key third party suppliers to produce our computer control systems and key components, such as motors and drives for our machine tools. An unplanned interruption in manufacturing would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Such an interruption could result from a change in the political environment or a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or tsunami. Also, any interruption in service by one of our key component suppliers, if prolonged, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and any of several foreign currencies can increase our costs and decrease our revenues.. Our sales to customers located outside of the U.S., which generated approximately 71% of our revenues in fiscal 2017, are invoiced and received in several foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Pound Sterling and Chinese Yuan. Therefore, our results of operations and financial condition are affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar, both for purposes of actual conversion and for financial reporting purposes. In addition, we are exposed to exchange risk associated with our purchases of materials and components for our Taiwan manufacturing operations, which are primarily made in the New Taiwan Dollar and the Euro. We hedge our foreign currency exposure with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These hedge contracts only mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that our hedges will have their intended effects.. Our competitive position and prospects for growth may be diminished if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market.. The machine tool industry is subject to technological change, evolving industry standards, changing customer requirements, and improvements in and expansion of product offerings. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards, customers’ requirements and competitors’ product offerings and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis that are accepted in the market, are significant factors in maintaining and improving our competitive position and growth prospects. If the technologies or standards used in our products become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our business would be materially adversely affected. Developments by others may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.. We compete with larger companies that have greater financial resources, and our business could be harmed by competitors’ actions.. The markets in which our products are sold are extremely competitive and highly fragmented. In marketing our products, we compete with other manufacturers in terms of quality, reliability, price, value, delivery time, service and technological characteristics. We compete with a number of U.S., European and Asian competitors, most of which are larger, have substantially greater financial resources and have been supported by governmental or financial institution subsidies and, therefore, may have competitive advantages over us. Our financial resources are limited compared to those of most of our competitors, making it challenging to remain competitive.. 15. Fluctuations in the price of raw materials, especially steel and iron, could adversely affect our sales, costs and profitability.. We manufacture products with a high iron and steel content. The availability and price for these and other raw materials are subject to volatility due to worldwide supply and demand forces, speculative actions, inventory levels, exchange rates, production costs and anticipated or perceived shortages. In some cases, those cost increases can be passed on to customers in the form of price increases; in other cases they cannot. If the prices of raw materials increase and we are not able to charge our customers higher prices to compensate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.. Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.. The SEC requires disclosure by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires a disclosure report to be filed annually with the SEC, and requires companies to perform due diligence and to disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of components that are incorporated into our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in components manufactured by third parties through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.. Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.. The technology within our products evolves, and we periodically bring new versions of our machines to market. The phasing out of an old product involves estimating the amount of inventory required to satisfy the final demand for those machines and to satisfy future repair part needs. Based on changing customer demand and expectations of delivery times for repair parts, we may find that we have either obsolete or excess inventory on hand. Because of unforeseen future changes in technology, market demand or competition, we might have to write off unusable inventory, which would adversely affect our results of operations.. Acquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.. We may seek opportunities to expand our product offerings or the markets we serve by acquiring other companies, product lines, technologies and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:. •     difficulties     integrating the operations, technologies, products, and personnel of an acquired company;      •     diversion     of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business;      •     potential     difficulties completing projects associated with in-process research and development;      •     difficulties     entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, especially when competitors in such markets have stronger     market positions;. 16. •     initial     dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;      •     insufficient     revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions;       •     the     potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and      •     potential     for recording goodwill and intangible assets that later can be subject to impairment.. Acquisitions may also cause us to:. •     issue     common stock that would dilute our current shareholders’ percentage ownership;      •     assume     liabilities of an acquired company;      •     record     goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential     periodic impairment charges;      •     incur     amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;      •     incur     large acquisition and integration costs, immediate write-offs, and restructuring and other related expenses; and      •     become     subject to litigation.. Mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions will be successful. Further, no assurance can be given that an acquisition will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate an acquisition could harm our business and operating results in a material way. Even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that enhancements to those products will be made in a timely manner or that pre-acquisition due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.. Risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. For additional information, please see the risk factor above entitled, “Due to future changes in technology, changes in market demand, or changes in market expectations, portions of our inventory may become obsolete or excessive.”. Assets may become impaired, requiring us to record a significant charge to earnings.. We review our assets, including intangible assets such as goodwill, for indications of impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements for the period in which any impairment of these assets is determined, which would adversely affect our results of operations for that period.. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences.. We may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.  We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax-planning opportunities and other relevant considerations.  Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets.  Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We also earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of funds representing earnings of foreign subsidiaries may significantly impact our effective tax rates.. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions, including the U.S., may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory taxes, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including tax laws in the U.S. Similarly, changes in tax laws or regulations, including those in the U.S., could negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in a statutory tax rate may result in the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the relevant jurisdiction in which the new tax law is enacted, potentially resulting in a material expense or benefit recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income for that period.. 17. In December 2017, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed legislation that was approved and signed into law. This legislation could have a material benefit or material adverse impact on our effective tax rate, tax expense and cash flow. The Company is in the process of analyzing the potential aggregate impact the enactment of this passed legislation will have on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Any benefits associated with lower U.S. corporate tax rates could be reduced or outweighed by other tax changes adverse to our business or operations, such as new or additional taxes imposed on earnings and/or reinvested earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The aggregate impact of such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations.. Our continued success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.. Our future success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely principally on nondisclosure agreements, other contractual arrangements, trade secret law, trademark registration and patents to protect our intellectual property. However, these measures may be inadequate to protect our intellectual property from infringement by others or prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information and enforce our intellectual property rights through infringement proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.. The unanticipated loss of current members of our senior management team and other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results.. The unexpected loss of members of our senior management team or other key personnel could impair our ability to carry out our business plan. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. The loss of senior management or other key personnel may adversely affect our operating results as we incur costs to replace the departed personnel and potentially lose opportunities in the transition of important job functions.. If our network and system security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our data, to our employees’, customers’ or vendors’ data, or to our critical information technology systems, we may incur legal and financial exposure and liabilities.. As part of our business, we store our data and certain data about our employees, customers and vendors in our information technology systems. If a third party gained unauthorized access to our data, including any data regarding our employees, customers or vendors, the security breach could expose us to risks, including loss of business, litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Although we work closely with industry recognized manufacturers supporting the security measures we have employed in an effort to keep our technology current with the ongoing threats, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, and therefore we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in: the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information; the unauthorized release of employee, customer or vendor data and payment information; a loss of confidence by our customers; damage to our reputation; a disruption to our business; litigation and legal liability; and a negative impact on our future sales.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.. 18"
